  "dc_description_s": "Pennsylvania Census Block Group level results from the DVRPC/UC Davis EV Planning Toolkit for ArcGIS. Visit the Story Map here. This dataset contains current (2017) and projected numbers of Plug-In Electrical Vehicles (PEVs) at the census block group level for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The future PEV projections are based on a scenario in which 5 percent of passenger vehicles in Pennsylvania (or about 400,000 vehicles) are PEVs. This dataset also includes data projecting workplace charging demand in number of charging events and kilowatt-hours of demand by census block group based on the aforementioned PEV projections for the following three scenarios: workplace charging is free, workplace charging is the same cost as home charging, and workplace charging is twice the cost of home charging. The following datasets were used to obtain these results using the EV Planning Toolkit: 2017 vehicle registration data provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), version 7. Block group-to-block group commuting distances from DVRPC's Travel Improvement Model 2.1, accessed December 2017. Block group-to-block group commuting distances calculated from Esri's ArcGIS Network Analyst, used in 2017.
