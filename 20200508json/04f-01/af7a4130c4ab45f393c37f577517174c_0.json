  "dc_description_s": "Census Block Group level results from the DVRPC/UC Davis EV Planning Toolkit for ArcGIS. Visit the Story Map here. This dataset contains current (2017) and projected numbers of Plug-in Electrical Vehicles (PEVs) at the census block group level for the Delaware Valley region. The projected PEV distribution is based on a scenario in which 5 percent of passenger vehicles in the Greater Philadelphia region (or about 200,000 vehicles) are PEVs. Please note that the percentage of passenger vehicles that are PEVs is not available for the New Jersey side of the region due to data limitations. Also includes data projecting workplace charging demand in number of charging events and kilowatt-hours of demand by census block group based on the aforementioned PEV projections for the following three scenarios: workplace charging is free, workplace charging is the same cost as home charging, andworkplace charging is twice the cost of home charging. The following datasets were used to obtain these results using the EV Planning Toolkit: 2017 vehicle registration data provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. 2017 vehicle registration data from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission provided by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), version 7. Block group-to-block group commuting distances from DVRPC's Travel Improvement Model 2.1, accessed December 2017.If you have any questions regarding this dataset, please contact:Adam Beam, Research Analyst | Office of Energy and Climate Change Initiativesabeam@dvrpc.org | (215) 238-2830\n",
