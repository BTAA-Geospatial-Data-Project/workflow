  "dc_description_s": "Pennsylvania and New Jersey municipal level results from the DVRPC/UC Davis EV Planning Toolkit for ArcGIS. Visit the Story Map here. This dataset contains current (2017) and projected numbers of Plug-In Electrical Vehicles (PEVs) at the municipal level for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey. The municipal PEV counts were aggregated from the census block group counts, assigning the counts from each block group to the municipality housing that block group's centroid. The future PEV projections are based on a scenario in which 5 percent of passenger vehicles in Pennsylvania (or about 400,000 vehicles) are PEVs. The following datasets were used to obtain these results using the EV Planning Toolkit: 2017 vehicle registration data provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. 2017 vehicle registration data from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission provided by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), version 7. Block group-to-block group commuting distances from DVRPC's Travel Improvement Model 2.1, accessed December 2017. Block group-to-block group commuting distances calculated from Esri's ArcGIS Network Analyst, used in 2017.If you have any questions regarding this dataset, please contact:Adam Beam, Research Analyst | Office of Energy and Climate Change Initiativesabeam@dvrpc.org | (215) 238-2830\n",
