Every year the Treasurer's office collects 1st and 2nd half taxes typically due in February and July. Due dates vary by year. Although tax payers' properties or parcels can be marked as delinquent for late payments, the parcel will not be marked or flagged as a certified delinquent parcel until the end of a reconciliation period which ends mid- August (August 10th). A parcel will remain as a certified delinquent parcel until the Balance is paid in full (In other words, the Balance is $0.00).",
