The information here is an unofficial representation of zoning districts and those districts' designations for the convenience of the public on the Crawford County GIS Webpage. The data was made according to the Crawford County Planning Office's interpretation of the municipality's official zoning map, and was adapted to conform to the County's existing GIS data. The information here is not a substitute for a zoning officer's determination of a zoning district and should not be used for making decisions of consequence.",
