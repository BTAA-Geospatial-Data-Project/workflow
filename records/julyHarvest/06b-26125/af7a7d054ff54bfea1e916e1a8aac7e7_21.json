Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2019. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.",
