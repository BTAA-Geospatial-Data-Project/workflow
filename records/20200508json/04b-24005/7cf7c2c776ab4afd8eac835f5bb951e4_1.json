They identify specific projects to be implemented and provide recommendations for supportive encouragement, enforcement and educational programs. The two plans are the first two phases of a comprehensive plan for the entire County. Because of the level of detail needed to make specific recommendations, the planning effort was phased into three parts to focus on areas of manageable size, while being broad enough to develop in a bicycle network linking residential communities with employment, shopping and recreational areas.
