  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap. maryland. gov. The units of geography used for the 2010 Census maps displayed here are the Census tracts. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. The data collected on the short form survey are general demographic characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, household relationship, housing vacancy and tenure (owner/renter).
