For example, DC's enforcement camera program cites speeders, blocking the box, and other moving offenses..Moving violation locations are summarized ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation.Data was originally downloaded from the District Department of Motor Vehicle's eTIMS meter work order management system. Data was exported into DDOT s SQL server, where the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) geocoded citation data to the street segment level. Data was then visualized using the street segment centroid coordinates.",
