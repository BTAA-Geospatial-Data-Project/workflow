Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. These are not to be confused with utility or private easements. They are often placed after an alley closing for traffic or access. Very few of the actual lines have been captured in this dataset. Please visit http://vpm.dc.gov/ for additional information. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
