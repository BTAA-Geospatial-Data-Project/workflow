  "dc_description_s": "AbstractThe Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 established that all private buildings over 50 Benchmarking is defined as tracking a building s energy and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building s performance against past performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA s free DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR Benchmarking results for each privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking law For more informationdc.gov/energybenchmarking.PurposeThis data is used by the District [For 2012 File:] 2012 energy and water benchmarking data is being disclosed for privately owned buildings over 150",
