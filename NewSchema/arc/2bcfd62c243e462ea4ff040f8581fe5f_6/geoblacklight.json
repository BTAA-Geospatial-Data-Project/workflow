For short-count sites, estimates are made by factoring a short count using seasonal and day-of-week adjustment factors.Data Coverage: The dataset covers the entire State of Michigan (state-owned) Trunkline system.Update Cycle: AADT CAADT volumes are created and released every year.Contact: Kevin Krzeminski",
