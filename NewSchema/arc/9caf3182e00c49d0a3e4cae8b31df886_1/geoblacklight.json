  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap. maryland. gov. The TW_Points feature class is the official geospatial record depicting a very small subset (7) of water quality assessments on Maryland's 2014 Integrated Report (IR). These seven assessments, all in tidal waters, were placed in Category 4B as other technical fixes are expected to bring them into water quality standards attainment. Since these assessments do not adhere to the default tidal water listing scale they are represented as points denoting their approximate location. Users are advised to review additional IR information for a better description of the spatial extent of each assessment.",
