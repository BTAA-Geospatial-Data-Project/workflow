  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The Natural Filter Buffer Priorities for Water Quality (Phosphorus / Sediment) layers identify priority forest/grass buffer opportunities by subwatershed (MD HUC 8). The Natural Filter Buffer Targeting layers were used as a baseline for suitability rankings. Land use, hydrology, soil, and landscape characteristics were analyzed to rank buffer opportunities with high phosphorus and sediment removal potential. Last Updated: 6/9/2014",
