  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. To quantify rates of change (erosion or accretion) along coastal and estuarine shorelines in Maryland, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), in conjunction with Towson University s Center for Geographic Information Sciences (CGIS) and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), installed and ran a computer program, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), using as input a series of digital shoreline vectors dating from 1841-1995. Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a baseline landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs, DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect. Last Updated: Unknown",
