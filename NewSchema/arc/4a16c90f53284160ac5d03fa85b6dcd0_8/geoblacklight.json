  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The multiple vector file denotes the 32 areas designated in the state's Threatened and Endangered Species regulations (COMAR 08. 03. 08) under section . 10 Natural (1) Contain one or more threatened or endangered species or wildlife species in need of conservation; (2) Be a unique blend of geological, hydrological, climatalogical or biological features; and (3) Be considered to be among the best Statewide examples of its kind. Designation of these areas was developed in conjunction with the Critical Area Law and most fall within the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area. Sites outside the Critical Area are already owned by a public agency. Coverage is of attributed polygons only; attributes are NHA numbers and names from COMAR 08. 03. 08, and the USGS 7. 5 minute quadrangles upon which the original boundaries were manually drawn.
