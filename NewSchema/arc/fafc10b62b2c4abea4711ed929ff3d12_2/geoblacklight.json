  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap. maryland. gov. This feature class represents the location of assessed shellfish harvesting waters in Maryland. It was created using recent shoreline data from the Department of Natural Resources and bounding coordinates of restricted, conditional and seasonally conditionally approved areas as defined in a report entitled, 2011 Annual Bay Chart June 1 created by the Science Services Administration at Maryland Department of the Environment. In addition, coordinates from COMAR 26. 08. 02. 08 were used to define the boundaries of Use II, or non-shellfish, waters. Disclaimer: This feature class is not an authoritative source for determining whether shellfish harvesting is approved in certain Maryland waters. Nor should the information contained herein be solely used by shellfish harvesters to determine if their waters are safe for shellfish harvest and consumption. Instead, shellfish harvesters should consult MDE's Shellfish Harvesting website to get more up-to-date information on the opening and closure of shellfish waters.
