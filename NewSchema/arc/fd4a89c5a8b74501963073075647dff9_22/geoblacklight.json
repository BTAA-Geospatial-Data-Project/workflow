The 2007 Chesapeake Bay SAV Coverage was mapped from 1:24,000 black and white aerial photography to access water quality in the Bay. Each area of SAV was interpreted from the rectified photography and classified into one of four density classes by the percentage of cover. The SAV beds were entered into an ArcInfo GIS coverage using quality control procedures.",
