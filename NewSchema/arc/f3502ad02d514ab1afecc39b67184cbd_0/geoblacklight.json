  "dc_description_s": "This layer was generated based on the road inventory from ODOT. ODOT generates a \"DESTAPE\" file that has all of the segment end/begin points, mostly caused by intersections with other roads, but also where county and municipal boundaries are crossed or if speed limits change or other important changes in physical, maintenance, financial or regulatory responsibilities change.THIS FILE is strictly about intersections with County, Township, Private or other roads and Municipal streets. This is a node network, not a representation of stop signs or even any particular changes of the roads, strictly nodes in the network on \"non-state\" roads. ",
