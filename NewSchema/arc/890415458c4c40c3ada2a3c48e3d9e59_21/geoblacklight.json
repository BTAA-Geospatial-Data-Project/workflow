These neighborhood groups provide the District electorate with grass-roots experience in the electoral process. These SMDs boundaries, developed by the DC Council, are based on the 2010 Census of the District's population, with each SMD having approximately 2,000 residents. Representatives elected to each Single Member District sit as Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners. This data set reflects the boundaries approved by the DC Council in May, 2012, for official 2013 SMDs.",
