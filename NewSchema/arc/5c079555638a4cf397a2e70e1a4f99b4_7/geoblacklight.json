  "dc_description_s": "As an additional task and deliverable in the Green Infrastructure 2010 project, SEMCOG desired building outline data. Building outlines were captured and delivered as a stand-alone dataset and also incorporated into the land cover dataset to prioritize impervious over canopy. The delineation of building outlines was done using the SEMCOG 2010 imagery and was done through heads up digitizing in 2D. LiDAR was used in the extraction of an estimated building heights which was part of the deliverable. Adjusted from the SEMCOG building footprints vector file, the data was reprojected to the Oakland County projection.More information about the attributes are available here: http://www.oakgov.com/it/gis/Documents/metadata/Land_Data_Guidebook.pdf",
