The hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes An accompanying line shapefile is attributed with the highest hydrologic unit level for each hydrologic unit All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.",
