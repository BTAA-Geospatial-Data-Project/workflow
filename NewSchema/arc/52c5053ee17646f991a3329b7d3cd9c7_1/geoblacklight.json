  "dc_description_s": "The trail/path dataset shows existing and proposed trails and paths in Oakland County and neighboring communities. The coverage was compiled from several sources including the community master plans, multi-jurisdictional trail councils/commissions, the State of Michigan, Oakland County Parks and Recreation, and the Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority. Hard copy sources include listings, maps and 2010 orthophotography. The scale of the data collection varies by community. The road centerline dataset was used to designate the safety path if a specific side of the road was not mentioned. The key attributes include: names of the major trails, agency that maintains the pathway, type of pathway, and various activities that are allowed on the pathway.",
