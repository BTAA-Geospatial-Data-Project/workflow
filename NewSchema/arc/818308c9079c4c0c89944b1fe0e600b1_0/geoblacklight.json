  "dc_description_s": "Thanks to the 3,015 residents for their participation, the third year's results are in on a survey the City of Minneapolis conducted to understand how Minneapolis residents use computers, mobile devices and the Internet. Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. The results will inform priorities for the City s digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City s efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013.",
