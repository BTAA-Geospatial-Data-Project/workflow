  "dc_description_s": "Live Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) data pulled from NOAA METAR GeoJSON Feed for Iowa AWOS sites. Data is pulled every 5 minutes. This service feeds Iowa DOT's WeatherView ApplicationThe weather data provided here by the Iowa Department of Transportation only reflects conditions at the specified site. Because of Iowa weather patterns, conditions can vary greatly in a small area; i.e., weather conditions a few miles away from the sensor could be completely different. In addition, failure of the sensors, or the equipment processing the information, may occur and produce unreliable information. Therefore, this information should not be used as the only factor in determining whether to travel in a particular area. The Iowa DOT recommends you check a number of sources, including media weather reports, in making your travel plans.",
