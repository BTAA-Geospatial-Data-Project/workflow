  "dc_description_s": "The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a way of subdividing and describing land in the United States. The PLSS typically divides land into 6-mile-square townships. Each township is identified with a township and range designation. Township designations indicate the location north or south of the baseline, and range designations indicate the location east or west of the Principal Meridian. This map displays township boundaries. NOTE: Boundaries are only visible when zooming in on an area of the State. Warning: This dataset may not reflect legal boundary.",
