  "dc_title_s": "Solid Waste Disposal Sites, Historical: Ohio",
  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains locations of historical waste disposal sites in Ohio based on solid waste file archives at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The sites are primarily solid waste disposal sites, including municipal solid waste, industrial solid waste, residual solid waste, and construction and demolition debris. Some sites with hazardous waste are also included. The types of sites may include licensed landfills, landfills that existed prior to state regulatory programs, exempt waste sites, unauthorized dumps, open dumps, and disposal lagoons. Some sites in the database may have been partially or fully remediated and may no longer contain significant amounts of waste. The data are incomplete and are still in development.  New locations will be added and existing locations may be corrected.  This file does not include all sites regulated by Ohio EPA under other regulatory programs (e.g. there are many sites regulated under programs such as hazardous waste sites, surface water, \"brownfields\", etc. that are not included in this dataset). Data were developed from Ohio EPA archival files. The accuracy of the locations depends on the available information. Where possible, points were located on the actual waste unit, or within the tax parcel boundary where the waste was said to be located. Some points were located using coordinates or descriptive text in field notes, inspection reports, etc.  In some cases, the best available information is the nearest intersection or an address. When possible the data were compared against local tax maps to improve the accuracy of the locations. Additional sources of information included but were not limited to newspaper archives, solid waste district plans, pollution inventories, historical societies, and local governments. The information used in this dataset come from files that date back to the late 1960s and may not represent the current site conditions. The data includes only that known to Ohio EPA's solid waste regulatory program and may not include sites that were under past authority of other regulatory agencies such as local health departments. ",
