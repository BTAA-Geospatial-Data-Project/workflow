  "dc_description_s": "This dataset represents impaired lakes as determined by MPCA in 2011 for the 2012 reporting cycle to US EPA.  The lakes are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). MPCA adds additional lakes. Since the impaired lakes are a small subset of the NHD lakes, only that subset is included in the dataset.  This dataset includes impaired lakes which have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA, those that have a US EPA approved TMDL plan as well as those lakes that do not need a TMDL plan.",
