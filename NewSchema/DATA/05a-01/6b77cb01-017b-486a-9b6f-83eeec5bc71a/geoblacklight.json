  "dc_description_s": "Ayres Associates provided Dakota County with low level (6-inch) digital, color orthoimagery services in 2016. The aerial imagery was collected on August 5th, 6th, 8th,13th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 22nd, and 25th using an Microsoft Vexcel UltraCam Falcon sensor mounted in a fixed-wing aircraft. Aerial imagery was collected to support 0.1524 meter ground sample distance (GSD) orthoimagery to meet ASPRS Class II horizontal accuracy specifications at 1\" = 100' map scale. The horizontal accuracy meets or exceeds 2.0 feet RMSE using the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) standards. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to a DEM surface created using 2011 Twin Cities Metro data as part of the Statewide Minnesota LiDAR program. Orthoimagery was delivered in PLSS section GeoTiff and MrSID tiles and a project-wide MrSID mosaic. The orthoimgery was delivered according to a section tile schematic.",
