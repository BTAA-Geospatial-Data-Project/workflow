  "dc_description_s": "Ranked among America's most destructive tree pests, gypsy moth has caused millions of dollars in damage to forests as it has spread from New England to Wisconsin in recent decades. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) maintains a statewide monitoring program to watch for start-up infestations, and when an infestation is found, the department moves in to eradicate the pests before they can spread. This data set contains information on treatments scheduled for the current year. It will generally be refreshed with new information in January or February of each year.",
