  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http://imap.maryland.gov.Linear features which specifically show roadways included in the National Highway System (NHS) within the State of Maryland. Roadway NHS data is classified by roadway types, which include Airport, expanded NHS, Intercity Bus Terminals, NHS System, Pipeline Terminal, Port Facility, Public Transit, and Rail/Truck Terminal. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway NHS data is for planning purposes only and is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway'NHS data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other State and local government agencies. This data is key to understanding and identifying which roadways are part of the National Highway System (NHS) in the State of Maryland.Roadway NHS data is updated and published on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2015.Last Updated: 07/2016For additional data information, contact the MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) Team:TMS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial Technologies Team:GIS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):http://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):http://www.roads.maryland.gov/MDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
