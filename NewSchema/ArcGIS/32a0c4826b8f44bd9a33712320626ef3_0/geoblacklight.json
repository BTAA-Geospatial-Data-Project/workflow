  "dc_description_s": "This point feature class represents the center (not the true centroid) of each tax parcel polygon. The site address information is associated with each point that has a site address. Every point has a PIN (Parcel Identification Number) value. If there are multiple PINS associated with a particular tax parcel, the points are stacked on top of each other. If there are multiple site addresses associated with one PIN, these are stacked on top of each other as well. The points were created by a process that located the approximate center from the polygon feature class.",
