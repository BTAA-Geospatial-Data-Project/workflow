  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This data set contains OCS block outlines in ESRI Arc/Info export and Arc/View shape file formats for the MMS Atlantic Region. OCS blocks are used to define small geographic areas within an Official Protraction Diagram (OPD) for leasing and administrative purposes. These blocks have been clipped along the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary and along lines contained in the Continental Shelf Boundaries (CSB) GIS data files. Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these GIS files are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact OCS block boundaries. Only the paper document or a digital image of it serve as OFFICIAL records. The data was developed within the U. S. Government; no proprietary rights may be attached to them nor may they be sold to the U. S. Government as part of any procurement of ADP products or services. Last Updated: Unknown",
