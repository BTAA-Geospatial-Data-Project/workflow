  "dc_description_s": "DVRPC collects traffic volume, bicycle, and pedestrian counts at over 5,000 locations each year. The data is collected by the pneumatic tubes you see laying across the road. DVRPC also obtains traffic data collected by other entities and includes that data in its database as a public service. Traffic data is used by transportation engineers and planners, developers, market analysts, and may be of interest to the general public. This file is updated nightly.",
