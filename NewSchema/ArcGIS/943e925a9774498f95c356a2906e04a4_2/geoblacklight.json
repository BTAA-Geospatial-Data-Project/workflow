  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This is a comprehensive point theme that incorporates Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) property land characteristics for land types associated with a given parcel account number (ACCTID field). Data for the CAMA Land point theme are obtained from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation for all jurisdictions on a yearly basis. This is a multi-record per parcel account number point theme. The CAMA Land point theme can be joined to the CAMA Core point theme on parcel account number. The CAMA Land point theme should not be joined to the CAMA Building or Building Subareas point themes because this theme is a property and not a building point theme. For more information on the attribute definitions please see the MdProperty View User's Guide, available for download at http://planning. maryland. gov/OurProducts/downloadFiles. shtml. CAMA attribute definitions can be found in Appendix D of the User's Guide. Last Updated: Unknown",
