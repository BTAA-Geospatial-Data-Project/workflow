This dataset is a version of the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover classification adopted by Penn State University (Land Analysis Lab) for the Chesapeake Bay Basin Land Cover / Land Use Monitoring and Assessment Study. Aerial Imagery used for creation of this dataset was from PAMAP program in 2003. Other Layers Used in this layer is Parcels (for snapping and Landuse codes), Lakes and Ponds, Parks, Roads buffered to 11 feet on each side, Streams buffered to 6 feet on each side and Railroads buffered to 8 feet on each side.
