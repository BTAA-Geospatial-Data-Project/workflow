Language barriers may prohibit people who are Limited in English Proficiency (also known as LEP persons) from obtaining services, information, or participating in public planning processes. To better identify LEP populations and thoroughly evaluate the Commission s efforts to provide meaningful access, DVRPC has produced this Limited-English Proficiency Plan. This is the data that was used to make the maps for the upcoming plan.Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA), are geographies of at least 100,000 people that are nested within states or equivalent entities. States are able to delineate PUMAs within their borders, or use PUMA Criteria provided by the Census Bureau.Census tables used to gather data from the 2013- 2017American Community Survey 5-Year EstimatesACS 2013-2017, Table B16001: Language Spoken at Home by Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over. ACS data are derived from a survey and are subject to sampling variablity.*Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refers to those persons that speak English less than very well.
