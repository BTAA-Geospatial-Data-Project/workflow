Language barriers may prohibit people who are Limited in English Proficiency (also known as LEP persons) from obtaining services, information, or participating in public planning processes. To better identify LEP populations and thoroughly evaluate the Commission s efforts to provide meaningful access, DVRPC has produced this Limited-English Proficiency Plan. This is the data that was used to make the maps for the upcoming plan.Census tables used to gather data from the 2013- 2017American Community Survey 5-Year EstimatesACS 2013-2017, Table C16001: Language Spoken at Home by Ability to Speak English for the Population 5 Years and Over. ACS data are derived from a survey and are subject to sampling variablity.*Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refers to those persons that speak English less than very well. DVRPC has mapped the below Language Groups for our Plan.SpanishRussianChineseKoreanVietnameseSource of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau. The TIGER/Line Files ",
