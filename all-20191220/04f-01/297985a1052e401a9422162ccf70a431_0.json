The dataset uses the centerlines of undivided highway segments and ramps to depict each of the major freight serving highways as identified by DVRPC staff. The highways are limited to regional serving routes including interstates and limited-access highways. This dataset is mapped by route name number and is segmented at key interchanges and by several characteristics: road profile, V/C ratio and performance indicators.",
