As of February 2019, data has not been field checked. This dataset can be used to determine the presence of marked crosswalks as of 2017. Crosswalks will need to be verified before using this dataset as an accurate inventory.**UPDATE: Trails, bike lanes, and connectors have been removed due to change in methodology after data delivery.**Data will be updated periodically. To receive notifications when the data has been updated, please visit walk.dvrpc.org and add your contact information in the Stay in Touch section.See Pedestrian Data Development for the DVRPC Region Process Methodology, November 20, 2018 for more information.",
