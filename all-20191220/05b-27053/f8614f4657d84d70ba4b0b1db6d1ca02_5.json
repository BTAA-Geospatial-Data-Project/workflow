  "dc_description_s": "Since 2016, Hennepin County has organized counts at locations outside of Minneapolis, counting both pedestrians and bicyclists. These short term counts rely on volunteers collecting data over a two-hour window, from 4:00-6:00 PM during the second week of September each year. The raw data from the counts was then used to calculate estimated daily traffic (EDT) at each site, which means that 2-hour counts are extrapolated to understand larger trends in walking and biking. Hennepin County s volunteer counts take place in conjunction with the City of Minneapolis pedestrian and bicycle counts. Hennepin County leads the initiative for all counts outside of the City of Minneapolis; however, the county still utilizes data for county roads within the City of Minneapolis. This data shows the EDT for pedestrians and bicyclists at each intersection, in all directions.
