  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains the street centerlines of roadways in Hennepin County in the Metro Regional Centerline (MRCC) standard format. It is primarily used for geocoding purposes. The attribute table includes road names and geocoding ranges for each road feature. The associated street alias table can be joined to this dataset using the UNIQUE_ID field and the JOIN_ID field from the alias table. More recently, the dataset has been enhanced to better support routing, including the conversion of single line segments to dual carriageway for divided highways and boulevards and the addition of access ramps. Speed, elevation, and one way attributes are also provided, allowing this dataset to be built into a routable network dataset. Attribute information is defined by the MRCC standard. Information on the standard, including attribute definitions, is available on the MetroGIS MRCC project site at https://metrogis.org/projects/centerlines-initiative.aspx. While this dataset includes only Hennepin County roadways, it is intended to align with neighboring counties to provide a standard, multi-purpose regional street centerline dataset. The full regional dataset is available for download from MN Geospatial Commons. Data updated: daily This data (i) is furnished AS IS with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes. Hennepin County shall not be liable for any damage, injury or loss resulting from this data. General questions about this data set, including errors, omissions, corrections and/or updates should be directed to the Hennepin County GIS Office at 612-596-9484.",
