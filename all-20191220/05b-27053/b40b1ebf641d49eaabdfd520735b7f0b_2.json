  "dc_description_s": "This dataset is the Hennepin County tax parcel polygon layer in the MetroGIS format. MetroGIS compiles tax parcel polygon and point layers from the seven Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington. The seven counties are assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The field PIN is the parcel ID for each parcel address. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. The point layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel, and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores, or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many but not all counties. The seven-county dataset is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. (See http://www.metrogis.org/how-do-i-get/parcel-data.aspx for more information.) Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.Link to Attribute Table Information: http://gis.hennepin.us/OpenData/Metadata/MetroGIS%20Parcels.pdf Data updated: February 2016Use Limitations: This data (i) is furnished AS IS with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.
