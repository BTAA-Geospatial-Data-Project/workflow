Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) was used to correctly adjust and locate faciilities outside the metro area.Nursing home locations were extracted from the Minnesota Department of Health - Health Care Facility and Provider database on September 2018. Nursing homes were queried based on provider type of Nursing Homes from the from the master table. Once the nursing home records were isolated, address records were cleaned for geocoding. Geocoding was performed by the Hennepin County GIS Office using composite locators. Addresses found within the metropolitan area will have a higher degree of accuracy than those throughout Minnesota. Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) nursing home data from 2015 was used to correctly adjust and locate faciilities outside the metro area.Original data was downloaded from: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/fpc/directory/fpcdir.html and included the following statement: Health Care Facility and Provider Database: This database offers addresses, phone numbers, administrator names and state registration or licensure status for Minnesota health care providers.
