  "dc_description_s": "Download the full Hennepin County parcel dataset in Shapefile format. The County parcels dataset contains polygons representing individual taxed parcels or individual tax-exempt parcels tracked for taxing purposes. It also contains polygons representing the locations of multiple tax properties (multi-PID parcels). It is the combination of the parcel base dataset and the multiple parcel base dataset with attributes from a monthly extract of the property tax information system. The PID field contains the property ID number for each parcel.In the case of multiple tax properties, several parcel polygons may be stacked on top of one another. These are multiple tax parcels that cannot be delineated on a two-dimensional map, including both taxed and tax-exempt parcels. The parcels are represented with identical geometries but have different parcel IDs and associated tax attributes.
