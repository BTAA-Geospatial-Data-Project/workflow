Student safety zones are 1000' buffers around a school facility (Elementary, Middle and High school). Registered sex offenders are not permitted to live within these buffers. When a sex offender moves, they are required by law to register with the local law enforcement, who must verify that the address is not within a safety zone. Though the definition of a school safety zone could change with legislation, the parameters that were used to create this data were: A buffer of 1000 from the parcel boundary of the school (versus just the centroid of the parcel, or from the building itself)Any K-12 school, public or private, should have a buffer. Teaching needs to occur in the building (i.e., not admin-only buildings)Preschools and day cares are excludedThis polygon feature class was originally created by buffering the Oakland County's Educational feature class. The key attributes include the facility Name, Address,Type (Elementary, Middle, High) and Access (Public, Private).",
