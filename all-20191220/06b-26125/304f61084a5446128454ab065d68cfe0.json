LAS and bare earth DEM data products are suitable for 1 foot contour generation. USGS LiDAR Base Specification 1.2, QL2. 19.6 cm NVA.This metadata record describes the hydro-flattened bare earth digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the classified LiDAR data for the 2017 Michigan LiDAR project covering approximately 907 square miles, in which its extents cover Oakland County.This data is for planning purposes only and should not be used for legal or cadastral purposes. Any conclusions drawn from analysis of this information are not the responsibility of Sanborn Map Company. Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since this dataset was collected and some parts of this dataset may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Users should not use these data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations. Contact: State of MichiganDue to the large size of the data, downloading the entire county may not be possible. It is recommended to use the live service directly within ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro.
