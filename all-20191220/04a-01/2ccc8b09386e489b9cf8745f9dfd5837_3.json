Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This is a comprehensive point theme that incorporates Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) building subarea characteristics for building subareas associated with a given parcel account number (ACCTID field). Data for the CAMA Building Subareas point theme are obtained from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation for all jurisdictions on a yearly basis. This is a multi-record per parcel account number point theme. The CAMA Building Subareas point theme can be joined to the CAMA Core point theme on parcel account number or to the CAMA Building point theme on the multi-record CAMALINK field. For more information on the attribute definitions please see the MdProperty View User's Guide, available for download at http://planning.maryland.gov/OurProducts/downloadFiles.shtml. CAMA attribute definitions can be found in Appendix D of the User's Guide.Last Updated: UnknownFeature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/PlanningCadastre/MD_ComputerAssistedMassAppraisal/MapServer/3**Please note, due to the size of this dataset, you may receive an error message when trying to download the dataset.
