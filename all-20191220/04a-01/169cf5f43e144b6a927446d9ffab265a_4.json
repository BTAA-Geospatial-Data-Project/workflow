  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.QuesterTangent s SWATHVIEW seabed classification software to post-process the 410 kHz side scan sonar signal. This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes.Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data.REFS: Conkwright, R.D., Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E.R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.
