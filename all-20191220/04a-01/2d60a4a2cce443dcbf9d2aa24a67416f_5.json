The vector format was created from the SHA Shoreline file and graphic representations in the Lippson book (See bibliography below). These areas were then confirmed with the White book (See bibliography below) and the Habitat Requirements for Chesapeake Bay Living Resources. While not a fishery in Maryland, they are a prey species for larger fisheries in the Chesapeake. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.
