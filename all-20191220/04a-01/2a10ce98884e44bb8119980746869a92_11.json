Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Polygon dataset characterizing bottom type designations determined by Md DNR's Acoustic Bay Bottom Survey conducted from 1974 to 1983. Bottom type designations include cultch, mud, sand, leased bottom, hard bottom, mud with cultch and sand with cultch. Note: The data in this file is up to 30 years old and areas designated as cultch bottom when this survey was conducted have likely degraded. For this reason, it is very likely that many of the areas shown as cultch in the dataset are no longer valiid. The data in this file should only be used as a general guide.The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
