Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This is a data table, in comma-delimited, ASCII format, which contains information about selected physical properties, particularly grain size, of 4,255 surficial sediment samples from the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Samples were collected on a 1-km grid by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) between June 1976 and August 1984.Consider the age of the data (1976-1984), the sampling density (1-km grid) and the spatial and temporal variability of estuarine sediments in evaluating the fitness for use of this data set. Graphic displays and printed tabular listings derived from this data set may be used in publications and presentations, provided that credit is given to the originators of the data set (see Section 1.1).Funding for the Chesapeake Earth Science Study was provided by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) under Contract No. EPA R805965.Feature Service Layer Link: https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_Soils/MapServer/5",
