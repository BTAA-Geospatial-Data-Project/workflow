Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This layer is a network of public ditches that cover large areas of the middle parts of the Delmarva. These ditches help drain 183,000 acres of land composed of crop land, forest land, roadways, commercial areas and home sites, conveying storm water runoff from rural towns on Maryland s Eastern Shore. The Maryland Department of Agriculture worked in conjunction with the Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC) at Salisbury University to produce this comprehensive digital representation of Public Drainage Associations and Public Watershed Associations on Maryland s Eastern Shore.Map Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Agriculture/MD_NutrientManagementSetbacksFromWaterways/MapServer/3",
