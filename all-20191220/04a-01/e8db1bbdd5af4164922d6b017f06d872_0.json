Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The sample sites are color coded according to the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI) scores. Anything below a BIBI score of 3.0 is red (Poor), 3.0-3.9 is yellow (Fair), and 4.0-5.0 is green (Good).Begun as a pilot in 2000, Maryland Stream Waders is a statewide volunteer stream monitoring program managed by Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Monitoring and Nontidal Assessment Division. Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS).Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others.Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each), while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus, Stream Waders data should help fill the gaps left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS. Stream Waders sample, for the most part, in the sameoverall watersheds each year where MBSS crews sample.Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_StreamHealth/FeatureServer/0",
