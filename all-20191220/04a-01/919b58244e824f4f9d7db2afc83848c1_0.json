Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The shoreline and littoral conditions maps were produced in 1982 as part of a study of shore erosion in the northern Chesapeake Bay, that is, the Maryland part of the Bay (Wang et al, 1982). In the early 1990s, the Maryland Geological survey contracted the services of a private company to scan and georeference 56 shoreline and littoral conditions maps.Feature Service Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Geoscientific/MD_LittoralDriftMaps/FeatureServer/0",
