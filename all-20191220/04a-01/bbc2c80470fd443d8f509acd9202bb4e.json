Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Dewberry collected LiDAR for ~3,942 square miles in various Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland Counties. The acquisition was performed by Geodigital. This metadata covers the LiDAR produced for the Fairfax, Fauquier, Frederick, and Jefferson County project area. The nominal pulse spacing for this project is 1.6 ft (0.5 meters). This project was collected with a sensor which collects intensity values for each discrete pulse extracted from the waveform. GPS Week Time, Intensity, Flightline and echo number attributes were provided for each LiDAR point. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to contract specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity, and 11-Withheld. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 2150 tiles (1500 m x 1500 m) that cover this deliverable.Image Service Link: https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Frederick/MD_frederick_aspect_m/ImageServer",
