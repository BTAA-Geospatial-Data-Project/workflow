Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.MDOT SHA District Boundaries data consists of polygon features which represent the boundaries of each Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) District. Each MDOT SHA District includes multiple Maryland Counties. There are a total of seven MDOT SHA Districts (District 1 - District 7) throughout the State of Maryland. MDOT SHA District Boundaries data was generated using geometry from Maryland's political county boundaries.MDOT SHA District Boundaries data is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Governance Division (DGD). MDOT SHA District Boundaries data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. MDOT SHA District Boundaries data is key to understanding and identifying the geographic extent for each MDOT SHA District.MDOT SHA District Boundaries data is updated and published on an As-Needed basis, as this data does not frequently change.
