Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Benthic data were aggregated from multiple sources to create a baywide record of seabed material in the Chesapeake Bay. Habitat polygons are classified with an adaptation of the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) Substrate Component (SC). Source data were collected during the interval 1842-2014. Because of potential temporal changes in bottom conditions and deficiencies in survey methodology, benthic habitat characterizations may be in error in some areas. These are, however, the best data currently available.This is a subset of an original dataset which may be found here: http://ftp.ncbo.cgclientx.com/ecoscience/Chesapeake_Bay_Coastal_and_Marine_Ecological_Classification_Standard_CMECS/Metadata/MD_Bay_Bottom_Survey/.
