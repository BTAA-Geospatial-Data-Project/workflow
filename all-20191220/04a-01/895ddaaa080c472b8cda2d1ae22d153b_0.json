Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Point features which represent the locations of mile marker signs along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Mile Markers data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other State and local government agencies for purposes such as planning, land use, transportation, data asset collection. Roadway Mile Markers data is published on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year.
