Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This layer is the MGRS 100,000m grid that covers Zone 18S which covers part of Maryland.The U.S. National Grid provides a standardized grid reference system that is seamless across jurisdictional boundaries and allows for pinpointing exact locations. Since USNG is standardized, it can be understood and used as a common geographic framework for response. Zone 18S covers part of Maryland. The vertical UTM boundaries are horizontal latitude band boundaries form (generally) 6 X 8 Grid Zones. Hence, the first three letters of the MGRS value, e.g. 18S , are referred to as the Grid Zone Designator (GZD). The fourth and fifth characters are a pair of letters identifying one of the 100,000-meter grid squares within the grid zone (or UPS area). The S in this instance is not to be confused with UTM Zone 18S for UTM in the Southern Hemisphere. There are no classification restrictions on this information.
