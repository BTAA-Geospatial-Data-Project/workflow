The imagery is in response to Integrated Ocean and Coastal Mapping requirements. The aerial photography missions were conducted by NOAA's National Geodetic Survey, Remote Sensing Division. Images were acquired from various altitudes ranging from 3,500 to 7,500 feet, using a Trimble Digital Sensor System (DSS) at a 37.5 degree look angle.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.
