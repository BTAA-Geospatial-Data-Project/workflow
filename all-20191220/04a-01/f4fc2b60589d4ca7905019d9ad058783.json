This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.Image Service Link: https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BaltimoreCity/MD_baltimorecity_dem_m/ImageServer",
