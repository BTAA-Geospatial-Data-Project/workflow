  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Administrative Classification (State Classifications) data consists of linear geometric features which specifically show State highways included in the State Primary and State Secondary systems throughout Maryland. Roadway Administrative Classification is primarily used for general planning and funding purposes by showcasing the State Primary vs. State Secondary systems. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Administrative Classification is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Administrative Classification data is developed and maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Administrative Classification data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Administrative Classification data is key to understanding which State highways are included in the State Primary and State Secondary systems throughout Maryland.Roadway Administrative Classification data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017. For additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial Technologies Team:Email: GIS@mdot.state.md.usFor additional MDOT information, visit the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):Website: https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional MDOT SHA information, visit the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):Website: https://www.roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspxMDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
