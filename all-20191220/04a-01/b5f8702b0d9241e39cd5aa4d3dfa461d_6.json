Full reports and associated files are available for download at https://data.noaa.gov/dataset. Sheet H11649 was surveyed from August 17, 2007 to November 18, 2007. Sheet H11650 was surveyed from September 29, 2007 to November 18, 2007. Sheet H11872 was surveyed from July 16, 2008 to December 19, 2008. Sheet H11873 was surveyed from October 13, 2008 to December 18, 2008. Bottom class polygons with CMECS classifications based on ARC GIS 10.2 maximum likelihood raster classification performed on compiled side scan sonar mosaic raster. Side scan data collected by SAIC and provided by NOAA. Funding to compile these datasets provided by BOEM under cooperative agreement number: M14AC00007. Data processing and compilation was executed by Maryland Geological Survey.The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) or any of its sub-agencies.This geodatabase was created to provide planners and managers access to data about aggregate resources off the coast of Maryland.
