Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.In 2007, State leaders in Maryland took a bold step in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay with the creation of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded, the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually. This file depicts the Bay Trust Fund Project locations. Feature Service Link: https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_TrustFund/FeatureServer/0",
