  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Posted Speed Limit Signs data consists of point feature geometry which represents the geographic location of posted speed limit signs along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Posted Speed Limit Signs data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Posted Speed Limit Signs data is key to understanding the location of posted speed limit signs throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Posted Speed Limit Signs data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.
