Dataset Description: Garrett County, MD 2015 LiDAR project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM Zone 17, NAD83 (2011), meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 6 individual 1829 meter X 1219 meter tiles for the pilot (948 individual 1829 meter X 1219 meter tiles for the entire project area), and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1829 meter X 1219 meter tile schema, and Breaklines in Esri geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2015, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 87 Land Cover control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Garrett County, MD project area (20 calibration control points).Image Service Link: https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Garrett/MD_garrett_dem_m/ImageServer",
