Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Although the State of Maryland has no natural lakes, it has an abundance of created lakes and ponds that are used for wildlife habitat, recreation, water supply, and other reasons. This digital file shows the locations of the largest and most significant lakes, as well as some of the smaller lakes and ponds in the state. Most of the digitized lakes and ponds are greater than 2 acres.These data represents the results of data collection/processing for a specific Maryland Department of Natural Resources activity and indicates general existing conditions.
