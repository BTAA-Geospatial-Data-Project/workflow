Class 2 (ground) lidar points in conjunction with the hydro breaklines were used to create a 2 foot hydro-flattened Raster DEM. Geographic Extent: The entire project area covers Ellicott City; approximately 42 square miles. Dataset Description: This VA_UpperMiddleNeck_2018_D18 project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at an aggregate nominal pulse spacing (ANPS) of 0.35 meters (8ppsm). Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.3. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), Maryland State Plane, feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), feet. Lidar data was delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to individual 4000 ft x 6000 ft tiles, as tiled Intensity Imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 4000 ft x 6000 ft schema.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.
