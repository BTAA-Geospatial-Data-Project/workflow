  "dc_description_s": "Pavement Condition NHS (2017) data consists of linear geometric features which represent roadway pavement conditions along the National Highway System (NHS) throughout the State of Maryland. This data product includes the national transportation performance measure infrastructure conditions, specifically the Good, Fair, Poor condition ratings which are based on overall International Roughness Index (IRI) values, Good (IRI 170), Fair (IRI 96 - 170), Poor (IRI 170 - 636). This data product will assist Maryland Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) with analyzing baseline pavement conditions along the Maryland NHS in an effort to inform improve 2-Year 4-Year performance targets.Maryland Pavement Condition NHS data is updated and maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) Office of Materials Technology (OMT). This data product is consistently maintained and updated on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year. This geospatial data product is for the year 2017.Last Updated: February 2019 (2/25/2019) For additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial Technologies Team:Email: GIS@mdot.state.md.usFor additional data, visit the MDOT GIS Open Data Portal:Website: https://data.imap.maryland.gov/pages/mdot/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):Website: https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):Website: https://www.roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspxMDOT Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer: This data is provided AS IS without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.
