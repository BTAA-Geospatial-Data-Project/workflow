  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Access Control data consists of linear geometric features which showcase the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Access Control data is commonly classified by three (3) control types, which are Full Access Control, Partial Access Control, and No Access Control. Roadway Access Control data is primarily used for general planning purposes, investment requirements modeling to calculate capacity and estimate type of design, in truck size and weight studies, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Access Control data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Access Control data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Access Control data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Access Control data is key to understanding the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland.Roadway Access Control data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.For additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial TechnologiesEmail: GIS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):http://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):http://roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspxMDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
