  "dc_description_s": "ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Feature Layer which includes the MDOT SHA Hurricane Florence Model - Inundated Parcels geospatial data product.MDOT SHA Hurricane Florence Model - Inundated Parcels data consists of polygon geometric features which represent the geographic locations of property parcels throughout the State of Maryland impacted by predicted storm surge during an event similar to Hurricane Florence (2018). This data seeks to replicate conditions of an event of similar magnitude.In light of the significant damage in the state of North Carolina caused by the storm surge from Hurricane Florence on September 14, 2018, concerns about the vulnerability of the coastal communities on the Atlantic coast of Maryland and in Maryland s portion of the Chesapeake Bay have come into focus. This data showcases a what-if scenario for coastal Maryland.MDOT SHA Hurricane Florence Model - Inundated Parcels data was produced as a result of efforts by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC), Salisbury University (SU), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This data was task-based, and will only be updated on an As-Needed basis where necessary.Last Updated: 10/04/2019For additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial Technologies Team:Email: GIS@mdot.maryland.govFor information related to the data, visit the Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC) websiteWebsite: https:www.esrgc.org/mapServices/For additional data, visit the MDOT GIS Open Data Portal:Website: https://data.imap.maryland.gov/pages/mdot/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):Website: https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):Website: https://www.roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspxMDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
