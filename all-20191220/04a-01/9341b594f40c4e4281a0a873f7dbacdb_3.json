Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.The TW_8DigitShed feature class is the official geospatial representation depicting tidal 8-digit watershed assessments as described in Maryland's 2014 Integrated Report (IR) of Surface Water Quality. In general, tidal assessments in the Chesapeake Bay are made at the salinity segment scale. However, some older assessments and impairments that are valid in 2014, still use the old 8-digit watershed boundaries. In order to accurately capture this assessment scale, this feature class was created. In general, IR assessments at tidal 8-digit watershed scale include assessments for PCBs in fish tissue and metals. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.Map Service Link: https://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDE_Water_Quality/MD_IntegratedReport_SurfaceWaterQuality2014/MapServer/3",
