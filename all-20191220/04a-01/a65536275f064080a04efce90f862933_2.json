Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.Under contract with the State of Maryland s Department of Natural Resources (MDNR),Versar provides support to the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) - a comprehensive survey to assess the status of biological resources in Maryland s non-tidal streams, identify stresses and impacts, and establish a means to monitor the condition of the streams. Round One of the MBSS (a three-year study, 1995 to 1997) was based on a stream network derived from a GIS data set at a 1:250,000 scale. Round Two of the project, conducted in 2000-2004, required a finer scale in the base stream network, and a refined sampling design focusing on Maryland's 8-digit watersheds. Stream data at a 1:100,000 scale were selected as an suitable base for the second round of the project.Feature Service Link: https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_StreamHealth/FeatureServer/2",
