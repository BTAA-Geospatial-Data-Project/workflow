The three counties comprising the HATS region are Dauphin, Cumberland and Perry. Data was collected via aerial imagery from Goggle Maps and data input was done by staff at Harrisburg University. Sidewalk lines are represented by a single line through the center of the street. Fields within the attribute table present overall presence (sidewalk on one side of the street, sidewalk on both sides of the street, no sidewalk) and separate fields for sidewalk on either side of the street.",
