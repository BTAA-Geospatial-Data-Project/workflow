The primary factors in establishing CSAs are transportation infrastructure and public sewer and water service areas, although other factors are also considered, including access to public transit, emergency services, and community services.The primary objective of the TCRPC's Regional Growth Management Plan (RGMP) project is to update and coordinate revised physical growth policies to the year 2040 in conjunction with the Regional Transportation Plan. Other objectives include: Preparing and maintaining a coordinated and uniform data collection and analysis process that may provide on a continuous basis, summary data on population, land use, natural resources, public services and utilities of the region. Promoting cooperation among Regional, County, and local planning activities. Promoting a better understanding by pubic officials, planners, engineers, surveyors, and property owners, of interrelationships between land use and transportation, public utilities, services and factors influencing physical growth and development within the Region. Establishing an increased awareness of the effects individual local community plans have on the development of surrounding communities. Maintaining data vital to forecasting and recommendations made regarding future transportation improvements, economic activity, population densities and distribution, and land development. Reinvigoration formal and informal mechanisms for continuous public participation and public involvement within TCRPC's planning program.",
