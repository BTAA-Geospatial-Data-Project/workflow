  "dc_description_s": "*The Location Based Response System (LBRS) is an initiative of the Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program (OGRIP). The LBRS establishes partnerships between State and County government for the creation of spatially accurate street centerlines with address ranges and field verified site-specific address locations. Funding to support the development of LBRS compliant systems is available to counties through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that establishes roles and responsibilities for program participation. Participating counties provide project management and QA/QC on road names, addresses, etc to develop data that is compatible with the state's legacy roadway inventory. The Ohio Department of Transportation is the LBRS Program Sponsor, providing technical guidance, support, and QA/QC services. The program is being administered by OGRIP, the state's coordinating body for Geographic Information System (GIS) activities. Through the collaborative efforts of State and Local government the LBRS program is producing highly accurate field verified data that is current, complete, consistent, and accessible. LBRS data is maintained as an Ohio asset by local resources and is provided to the state as part of a coordinated long-term effort by OGRIP to reduce redundant data collection by developing data that meets the needs of several levels of government. The LBRS supports a multi-jurisdictional approach to protecting the health, safety and welfare of the state s constituents. *http://ogrip.oit.ohio.gov/ProjectsInitiatives/LBRS.aspx",
