The digital soil survey dataset was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey, compiling information from digitized maps and remotely-sensed data. This data is available for download through the?USDA NRCS GeoSpatial Data Gateway. Included with the geographic data are tables including tabular data on a variety of soil statistics and attributes. For the convenience of its residents, SCGIS joined the tabular hydric data to the soil survey polygon layer clipped to the Stark County boundary in 2015. This data reflects the last major update to the gSSURGO dataset and SCGIS has no intention of updating or adding additional tabular data to this layer in the future. For the complete dataset, including any updates, please visit the USDA NRCS GeoSpatial Data Gateway using the link provided above.",
