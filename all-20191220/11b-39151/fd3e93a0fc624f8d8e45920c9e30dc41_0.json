A stormwater BMP is a structural or non-structural method of treating, controlling, or storing surface water runoff. BMPs are required on all new development sites in which 1 or more acre of land is disturbed in accordance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II requirements. This layer also includes stormwater storage structures that predate NPDES requirements.",
