  "dc_description_s": "The Stark County Land Reutilization Corporation (SCLRC) operates as the county's land bank, in which foreclosured properties held by by banks or other agencies are acquired by SCLRC to be rehabilitated through a variety of programs. These properties can also be sold to qualified private rehabbers. If a structure cannot be rehabilitated, it is demolished. The resulting vacant land can be used in any number of ways, including but not limited to new public green space, stormwater management, or other innovative ecological purposes. The SCLRC aims to end the unbridled land speculation and flipping of foreclosed properties that has contributed to the current crisis.For more information, see?Stark County Land Reutilization Corporation (SCLRC).",
