Outdoor warning sirens are to alert those who may be outdoors that a tornado warning has been issued; they are not meant to alert those indoors. If you are outdoors and hear these sirens you should seek shelter immediately. This data was found on Google Maps and we are not sure who the author is. The locations seem to be accurate at a glance but a thorough investigation of each point has not been conducted. This data was created in 2018 and will only be updated upon the notification of incorrect data or the addition of new siren locations.",
