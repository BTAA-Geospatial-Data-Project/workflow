The Census Bureau's urban areas represent densely developed territory, and encompass residential, commercial, and other non-residential urban land uses. To qualify as an urban area, the territory identified according to criteria must encompass at least 2,500 people, at least 1,500 of which reside outside institutional group quarters. The Census Bureau identifies two types of urban areas: Urbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more peopleUrban Clusters (UCs) of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people. This layer was originally downloaded from Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles page on the US Census Bureau website and clipped to the Stark County boundary. For more information on urban and rural classification and criteria, visit the US Census Bureau Geography page.",
