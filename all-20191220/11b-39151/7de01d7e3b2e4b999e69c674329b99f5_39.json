Inlet structures typically have grated covers, but may also have open windows on the side to allow runoff to enter. The features in this layer are part of a combined stormwater layer maintained by the Stark County Engineer (SCE) and Stark County Regional Planning Commission (SCRPC). It only includes features owned and maintained by the County Engineer, as well as features located in the census-designated urbanized areas of Stark County's townships - which were collected by SCRPC. For a more expansive inventory of stormwater features in the county, use the?Stark County Stormwater Systems?layer on ArcGIS Online.",
