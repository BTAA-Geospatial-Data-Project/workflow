Most of the data comes from the building permits issued by the city, especially from 1877 to 1949. Sources are named for all buildings and other sources include real estate maps, tax assessments, newspaper reports, and the DC Office of Tax and Revenue, mosty for buildings after 1949. Work on this data is ongoing but we feel that this will be a valuable and enjoyable research tool as it is.",
