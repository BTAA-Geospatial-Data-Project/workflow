  "dc_description_s": "Square Points. Squares are calculated by the outer extents of the record or tax lots within a defined area (typically a city block). There are roughly 4896 active squares. A Square is similar to a city block. Squares were numbered starting at 1 and are currently in the 6000 series. Not all squares are active. A common cause of squares becoming inactive has been through street closing and combining squares. When the squares are combined usually the lower square number is killed and the higher square number is used for the combined square. For example if squares 1 and 2 are combined, square 1 is killed and the combination becomes square 2.Spatial locations:Each Square is an Island, alone unto itself. There is not now, and has never been, any citywide Survey Coordinate System in D.C. Most squares are unrelated to other Squares by Measured. They are related by Record. Street width is approximate. You cannot rely on the published official street widths to set up property lines or determine right-of-way. There is digital scan information available from DDOT regarding Right-of-Way. Some Squares are divided by streets. That is, the same Square continues on the other side of the street. Since there is no citywide Survey Coordinate System, squares were placed in their approximate location. This process is known as best fit .Created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.
