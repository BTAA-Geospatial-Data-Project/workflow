For analysis purposes, RPTA delineates assessment neighborhoods to group properties that are affected by similar economic, political, governmental, and environmental factors. Assessment neighborhoods are defined by the environment of a subject property that has a direct and immediate effect on its value. The assessment neighborhood is a geographic area (in which there are typically fewer than several thousand properties) defined for some useful purpose, such as to ensure for later multiple regression modeling that the properties are homogeneous and share important locational characteristics. Assessment neighborhoods boundaries typically follow street centerlines, hydrological boundaries, and boundaries of major properties such as parks and monuments.These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations.  There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset.  Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries.",
