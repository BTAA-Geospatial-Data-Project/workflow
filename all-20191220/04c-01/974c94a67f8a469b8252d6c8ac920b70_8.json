For example, the?District Department of Transportation's (DDOT)?traffic control officers who?prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the?District?Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation.?The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over?50 different combinations of violations.??Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, what type of parking violations occurred the most in the time period of this data? These data will give up to?26 distinct street segments of information ? one for each week of the half year.Field Definitions:Identification?Weeknumber ?
