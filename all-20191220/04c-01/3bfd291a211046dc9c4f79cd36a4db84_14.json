Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. Census tracts were identified from maps provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and the D.C. Office of Planning. The tract polygons were created by selecting street arcs from the WGIS planimetric street centerlines. Where necessary, polygons were also heads-up digitized from 1995/1999 orthophotographs.
