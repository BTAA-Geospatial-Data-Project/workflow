Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These features were originally captured in 1999 and updated in 2005. The following planimetric layers were updated: - Building Polygons (BldgPly) - Bridge and Tunnel Polygons (BrgTunPly) - Metro Entrance Points (MetroEntPt) - Obscured Area Polygons (ObsAreaPly) - Railroad Lines (RailRdLn) - Road, Parking, and Driveway Polygons (RoadPly) - Sidewalk Polygons (SidewalkPly) - Under Construction Areas (UnderConstPly) - Wooded Areas (WoodPly) The following planimetric layers are new: - Horizontal and Vertical Control Points (GeoControlPt) - Hydrography Center Lines (HydroCenterLineLn).",
