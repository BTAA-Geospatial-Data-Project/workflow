Barbershops have always been a culturally significant place for men to gather and discuss current events, politics, and sports. It s a place where fathers spend time with their children and where boys learn to become men. Now it is a place for reading and learning too. CFMB s Books and Barbershops is a community visibility program that raises awareness on the value of academic mentoring, specifically in the area of early childhood literacy. We encourage you to ask one of the barbers for a book and read it to the children next to you. For more information, please visit https://cfmb.dc.gov/page/books-and-barbershops.",
