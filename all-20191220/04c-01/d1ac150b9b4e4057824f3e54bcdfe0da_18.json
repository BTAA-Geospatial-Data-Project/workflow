The Community Arts Grant (CAG) provides support for small-scale projects to promote arts and humanities activities to a diverse range of communities in the District of Columbia. For DCCAH, Community Arts refers to artistic projects that impact District residents based on geographic location, common interests or shared identities. This grant program gives the applicant the opportunity to expand on its own definition of community. The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities recognizes the importance of remaining relevant in a city of competitive opportunities for residents who have at their disposal significant discretionary income for arts and cultural offerings. Further, according to the 2012 Arts and Economic Prosperity IV Study conducted by Americans for the Arts, $1.1 billion in economic activity is generated annually by the non-profit arts and culture industry in Washington, DC. Additionally, the culture industry returns $80 million in local tax revenue to the District s coffers. These trends create an opportunity for DCCAH to position itself at the forefront of the city s cultural planning. To achieve this goal, DCCAH will endeavor in a cultural planning process to understand the strategic opportunities that will be central to accomplishing this broad vision.",
