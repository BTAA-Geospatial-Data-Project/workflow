The City Arts Projects (CAP) grant provides project support for individuals and organizations to execute projects that promote arts and humanities activities to a diverse range of communities within the District of Columbia. The DCCAH highly encourages small, medium and large projects that have District impact and engage District residents and visitors. Also, the DCCAH encourages community-based projects that share characteristics such as geographic location, common interests or a collective identity. Artistic projects may include, but are not limited to: concerts, visual arts exhibitions, literary readings, and festivals that feature dance, folk art, film, music, theater and other art forms. City Arts Projects will be reviewed by cohorts based on the project s artistic expense budget and projects produced by individuals or organizations. The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities recognizes the importance of remaining relevant in a city of competitive opportunities for residents who have at their disposal significant discretionary income for arts and cultural offerings. Further, according to the 2012 Arts and Economic Prosperity IV Study conducted by Americans for the Arts, $1.1 billion in economic activity is generated annually by the non-profit arts and culture industry in Washington, DC. Additionally, the culture industry returns $80 million in local tax revenue to the District s coffers. These trends create an opportunity for DCCAH to position itself at the forefront of the city s cultural planning. To achieve this goal, DCCAH will endeavor in a cultural planning process to understand the strategic opportunities that will be central to accomplishing this broad vision.",
