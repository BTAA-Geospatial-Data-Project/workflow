Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. The Intersection Points - MAR is primarly derived from DC Department of Transportation's (DDOT) Intersection Table in their Street Spatial Database (SSD). Regular at grade intersections (TYPE = 'REGULAR') as well as overpasses (TYPE = 'OVERPASS'), underpasses (TYPE = 'UNDERPASS') and ramps (TYPE = 'RAMP') are included. The overpasses, underpasses and ramps are based on street centerlines from DDOT. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.
