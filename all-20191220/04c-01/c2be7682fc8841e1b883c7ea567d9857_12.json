  "dc_description_s": "The Vision Zero data contained in this layer pertain to moving violations issued by the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and partner agencies with the authority to do so. For example, the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) traffic control officers who prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation. The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 40 different combinations of violations.  Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, where are the majority of Unsafe Operator moving violations in the AM Rush of 2009  These data will give up to 52 distinct street segments of information   one for each week of the year.Field Definitions:Identification Weeknumber   Week of Year, based on a Sunday start of the week StreetSeg   Street Segment ID, corresponds to the DDOT street centerline  StreetSegID  field Registered Name   Street nameStreetType   Type of Street (Road, Ave, etc)Quad   DC Quadrant FromAddLeft   Unit number start (for approximating this segment s block) ToAddLeft   Unit number end (for approximating this segment s blockMovingLow Speeding (Under 20mph) - speed violations under 20mphHigh Speeding (above 20mph) - speed violations over 20 mph including reckless drivingUnsafe Driving -violations for driving maneuvers unsafe to traffic Unsafe Vehicle - violations for vehicle characteristics unsafe to traffic Unsafe Operator- violations for operator (driver) characteristics unsafe to trafficOther- miscellaneous violationsImportant Notes:  Records which could not be associated to a street centerline segment (StreetSeg) were excluded from these summariesRecords which do not have a time of day associated with the violation were excluded from these summaries.",
