The building permit process is described on the DCRA website https://dcra.dc.gov/These data are shared via an automated process where addresses are batch matched (geocoded) to the District's Master Address Repository. Users may find that some data points will contain 0,0 for X,Y coordinates resulting in inconsistent spatial locations. Addresses for these data points could not be automatically geocoded and will need to be manually geocoded to 'best fit' locations in DC. Use the MAR Geocoder to help complete this.",
