IRBs can be used to finance, refinance, and reimburse the costs of acquiring, constructing, restoring, rehabilitating, expanding, improving, equipping, or furnishing real property and related subordinate facilities. More than $9.5 billion has been issued through Washington, DC's IRB program since 1994. Visit http://dmped.dc.gov for more information.",
