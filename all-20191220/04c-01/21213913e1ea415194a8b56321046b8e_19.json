  "dc_description_s": "DC Broadband Residential Wireline Adoption Rate by Ward. For the latest national information, Users should now refer to https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov.The dataset known as District of Columbia Broadband Adoption by Census Tract contains locations and attributes of broadband service available within the District of Columbia. The agregate data was compiled from data submitted by broadband providers and verified by the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) and the D.C. Public Service Commission for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). The project was funded by the United States Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) directed NTIA to develop and maintain a comprehensive nationwide inventory map of broadband service capability and availability, and to make the map publicly available via the Internet. NTIA is collecting data from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. Detailed information about this project can be found in the State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/frnotices/2009/FR_BroadbandMappingNOFA_090708.pdf) and subsequent clarifications. This data collection is to be conducted on a semi-annual basis over a five-year period. This data will attempts to reflect conditions in the field as of December 2009. The data is covered by nondisclosure agreements entered into by OCTO and broadband providers. The data contains COMMERCIAL / PROPRIETARY and CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The data is compiled solely for use by NTIA and cooperating federal agencies. Redistribution of the data in its raw form is prohibited. NTIA will use the data collected by grantees including the District of Columbia, in combination with other data sources, to create and publish online the National Broadband Map by February 17, 2011. The map will further educate consumers and businesses about broadband Internet availability, enable broadband Internet providers and investors to make better-informed decisions regarding the use of their private capital for future broadband investment, and inform the decisions of Federal, State, and local policymakers as they work to expand the benefits of broadband to all Americans.",
