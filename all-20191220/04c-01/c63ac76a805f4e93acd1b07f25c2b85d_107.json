Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These features were originally captured in 1999 and updated in 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013. The following planimetric layers were updated: - Building Polygons (BldgPly)- Bridge and Tunnel Polygons (BrgTunPly)- Grate (GratePly- Horizontal and Vertical Control Points (GeoControlPt) - Obscured Area Polygons (ObsAreaPly)- Railroad Lines (RailRdLn) - Road, Parking, and Driveway Polygons (RoadPly)- Sidewalk Polygons (SidewalkPly)- Stairs (StairPly)- Swimming Pools (SwmPoolPly)- Wooded Areas (WoodPly) All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
