Boundary geometries were updated for 2017 orthophoto capture. Adjusted the corners of the 11 tiles slightly outward to have all of them be evenly divisible by the GSD, the adjustment was only a few centimeters, an example is tile 2920 which was 800x800.901m (10000x10011.26 pixels) and adjusted to 800x800.96m (10000x10012 pixels).",
