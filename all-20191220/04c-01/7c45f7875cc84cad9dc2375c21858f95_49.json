The creation of this layer is automated, occurs weekly, and uses the most currently available tax information. The date of the extract can be found in the EXTRACTDATfield in this layer. Please visit http://vpm.dc.gov/ for additional information. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.?",
