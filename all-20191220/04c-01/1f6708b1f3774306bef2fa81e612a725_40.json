It represents all lands that are outside right-of-way.Record LotsTax LotsParcel LotsReservation LotsAir Rights LotsAll of which are found separately on http://data.dc.gov. The Office of Tax and Revenue maintains a database known as Information Tax System (ITS) that contains the accounts for the real property taxes. ITS records reference record lots, tax lots, parcels, condominiums and federally owned lands such as reservations. Information from ITS is conflated to Common Ownership Lot features by SSL (Square, Suffix and Lot). Note: this layer does not include condo records. These can be found in condo relate tables also found on http://data.dc.govThis layer is regenerated WEEKLY with an automated algorithm using the latest Pubic Extract information for attribution.",
