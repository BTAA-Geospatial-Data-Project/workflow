These features are created when a property transaction occurs that changes the boundary of a reservation.U.S. Reservations are lands acquired for use by the Federal Government after the original founding of the city. These were all acquired by the Federal Government through purchase, condemnation, dedication or gift and almost all of the U.S. Reservations in Washington are under the Jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Unlike Appropriations, U.S. Reservations are found throughout the city. The National Park Service also has information for every U.S. Reservation and Appropriation in addition to DCRA Office of the Surveyor having some detailed information on transactional history. It should be noted that RPTA has converted some reservations to tax lots for land tracking purposes however the federal government still maintains ownership in many of these cases.Please visit http://vpm.dc.gov/ for additional information.",
