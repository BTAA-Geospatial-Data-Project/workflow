The dataset contains polygons representing boundaries of District of Columbia voting precincts, established in 1992 (based on the Wards redistricted due to the 1990 Census) by the Board of Elections and Ethics. This data was created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. Precincts were identified from public records (DC Board of Elections and Ethics) and intially created selecting street arcs from the WGIS planimetric Street centerlines and, where necessary, heads-up digitized from the 1995 orthophotographs.
