  "dc_description_s": "ShotSpotter is gunshot detection, acoustic surveillance technology that uses sensors to detect, locate and alert law enforcement agencies of potential gunfire incidents in real time. MPD began implementing the ShotSpotter system in 2006 and has added sensors and upgraded components of the system at various times. ShotSpotter has also enhanced their ability to distinguish gunshots from other impulse noises. For example, the number of impulse noises coded as gunshots during Independence Day celebrations have significantly decreased over the past four years. ShotSpotter does not provide coverage for the entire District of Columbia. Official coverage areas are designed by ShotSpotter in conjunction with MPD, to target high population density areas with frequent sounds of gunshots incidents. A ShotSpotter incident may involve one gunshot or multiple gunshots depending on the time elapsed between each shot. Each incident is given a serial number ID when it occurs.This data may include duplicate incidents or unverified shots that may have occurred outside of official coverage areas. Classifications are assigned by ShotSpotter and represent their assessment of what kind of impulse noise occurred. The Latitude and Longitude of the incidents are rounded to three decimal places due to privacy concerns. This roughly corresponds to a 100 meter resolution.",
