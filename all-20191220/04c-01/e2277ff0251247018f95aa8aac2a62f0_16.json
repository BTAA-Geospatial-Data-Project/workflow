This dataset shows D.C. public middle school attendance areas where the new proposal will change where students attend elementary schools, added to the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These shape files display the areas throughout the city that have been rezoned to a new elementary, middle and high school attendance zone. Areas of the city could have been reassigned to a different school or reassigned to one of its current school options. These maps do not take into account phasing in policies. The new boundaries were recommended by the Advisory Committee on Student Assignment and accepted by the Mayor. These new boundaries will go into effect in the 2015-16 school year and significant phasing in policies will be put into place. See DME.dc.gov for more information.
