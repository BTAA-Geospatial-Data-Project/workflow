These digital data files are records of wetlands location and classification as defined by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) program. See the Entity_and_Attribute_Information section for a detailed description of NWI's Classification scheme. These wetlands were mapped by Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) using Maryland's Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads. Data are available in 3.75 minute by 3.75 minute blocks and contain wetlands point, line, and area features and attributes. The wetlands were photo interpreted from the photography flown for the Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads. These were flown over a period from 1988 to 1995.
