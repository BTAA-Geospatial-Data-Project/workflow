Digital orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Orthophoto data is produced through the use of digitized perspective aerial photographs or other remotely sensed image data. This data is processed into a digital product that has been rectified for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement caused by terrain relief, and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation.",
