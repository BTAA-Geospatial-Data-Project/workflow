A formal series of blue-and-white markers was launched in 1989 by the Penn State Alumni Association and the Office of Strategic Communications. The Alumni Association funds the project while the Strategic Communications office provides management services and coordinates the installation and maintenance of the markers with the Office of Physical Plant. The markers in general commemorate events and locations of broad importance to the intellectual and scientific development of Penn State as one of America's leading public universities.\",)",
