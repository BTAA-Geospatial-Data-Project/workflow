Flown aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Endeavour (11-22 February 2000), SRTM fulfilled its mission to map the world in three dimensions. The USGS is under agreement with NGA and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to distribute the C-band data. SRTM utilized dual Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR-C) and dual X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) configured as a baseline interferometer to successfully collect data over 80 per cent of the Earth's land surface, everything between 60 degrees North and 56 degrees South latitude.",
