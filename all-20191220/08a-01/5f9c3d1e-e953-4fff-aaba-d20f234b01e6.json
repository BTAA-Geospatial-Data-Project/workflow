The dataset consists of 1024 lidar point cloud LAS files. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. The data was collected at a nominal point spacing of 0.70m using Pictometry's Riegl LMS-Q680i LiDAR system over 4 mission days on April 18th, 19th, 22nd, and 25th, 2015. At the time of capture ground condiitons were leaf-off, snow free, and water was at normal levels.",
