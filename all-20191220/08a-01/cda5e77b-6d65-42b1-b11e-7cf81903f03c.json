  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a compilation of several data sets that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the Central Appalachian Forest of Pennsylvania. It is one of three groups used to create an overall Conservation Resources data set. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value. The following eleven data sets were created through SmartConservation\\xc2\\xae methodology using conservation values determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust. Interior Forest Habitat - 17% Slopes - 5% Contiguous Grasslands - 8% Contiguous Scrub Transitional - 7% Natural Vegetation Habitat - 17% Mammals Habitat - 12% Birds Habitat - 12% Herps (Terrestrial) Habitat - 12% Important Bird Areas - 5% Important Mammal Areas - 5% They were added and weighted together and the resulting raster was then reclassified into 10 quantiles as follows: 10 Quantiles (with zero excluded in quantile reclassification) Old Value New Value 0.36 - 0.712188 1 0.712188 - 1.416563 2 1.416563 - 1.894531 3 1.894531 - 2.271875 4 2.271875 - 2.674375 5 2.674375 - 3.102031 6 3.102031 - 3.58 7 3.58 - 4.108281 8 4.108281 - 4.762344 9 4.762344 - 6.8 10 The weighted percentages of each data set is shown above.",
