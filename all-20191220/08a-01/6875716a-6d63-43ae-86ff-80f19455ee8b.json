  "dc_description_s": "FEMA Historic Products - Once a FIRM or FIS has been superseded by a new version, it will be categorized as a Historic Product. After they move to this status, these products are no longer official and binding under the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). However, Historic Products may serve as valuable reference information and provide a record of an area\\'s changing flood risks over time. They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here. A LOMC is a formal document that communicates an official modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMCs are issued in place of a physical alteration and re-publication of the map. Regulatory Mapping Products Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - The official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Full FIRM panels are quite large (36\\' x 25.875\\'), so most users will prefer to print out a smaller selected portion called a FIRMette. This can be accomplished by selecting \"View\" once you have located your FIRM or by using the FIRMette - Desktop application. Flood Insurance Study (FIS) - A compilation and presentation of flood risk data for specific watercourses, lakes and coastal flood hazard areas within a community. The FIS report provides a detailed written account of a flood hazard mapping study and its findings. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) - Documents, including different types of Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), that are issued by FEMA to revise or amend the flood hazard information shown on the FIRM without requiring the FIRM to be physically revised and republished. In addition, FEMA issues a formal determination letter, called a LOMC Revalidation or LOMC-VALID letter - when one or more previously issued LOMCs are found to still be valid during a new flood mapping study of an area. Revalidation letters are included in the LOMC product results on this site.",
