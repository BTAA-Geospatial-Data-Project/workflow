They also may be released when the information is expected to be updated frequently, or when a limited audience is expected. Open-file reports are compiled by Survey staff and/or outside cooperators. They are reviewed for conformity with the open-file publication guidelines of the Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey but have not gone through a formal editorial review process. In terms of technical and geological content, the standards for preparation of texts for informal release should not vary in quality, accuracy, or precision from the standards applied to similar geologic texts destined for formal publication.",
