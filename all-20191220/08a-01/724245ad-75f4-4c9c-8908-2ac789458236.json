According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2008, by 2030 U.S. electricity production will need to increase by nearly 30 percent to meet growing demand. Currently, wind, solar and biomass supply 2.3% of our nation's electricity. While these renewable sources currently make up only a small fraction of energy production, renewable energy production is expected to increase by more than 70% between 2006 and 2030. Identifying and using land located in areas with high quality renewable energy resource will be an essential component of developing more electricity from renewable energy sources.",
