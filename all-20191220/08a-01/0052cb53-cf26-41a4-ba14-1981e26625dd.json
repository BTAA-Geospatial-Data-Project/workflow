Planting sites are based on 100-foot buffers around NHD High Resolution streams, areas, and water bodies. Qualifying areas have at least 0.25 acres of Low Vegetation land cover on a single tax parcel. Land cover data came from the 1-m High Resolution Land Cover produced by the Chesapeake Conservancy and University of Vermont. Sites are scored using a 0-3 score that combines Topographic Wetness Index, Sediment Trapping Efficiency, and upslope land cover. This version of the prioritization data includes the polygons for each planting area and is best suited for closeup, large-scale mapping and analyses.",
