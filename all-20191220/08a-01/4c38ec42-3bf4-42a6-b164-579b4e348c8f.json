This file was created by merging three small watershed datasets; (1) Smallsheds from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP); (2) Maryland Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 14 digit watersheds; (3) 1:24,000 scale watersheds from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). Pennsylvania watersheds are delineated at 1:24,00 while New York and Maryland watersheds are delineated mostly at 1:24,000 but some were delineated at larger or smaller scale. Additionally, the boundary between the Upper Susq. and Chemung Subbasins was updated to match the SRBC delineated subbasin line that exists on 1:24,000 scale USGS topographic maps.",
