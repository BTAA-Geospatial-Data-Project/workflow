The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Further the coding is hierarchical so that each group can be related to other codes within a general category. For example, in the Anderson system the general classification of forest is a 4, a deciduous forest is 41, and so on. For a description of the Anderson system see; http://landcover.usgs.gov/pdf/anderson.pdf This project was funded by The PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR)",
