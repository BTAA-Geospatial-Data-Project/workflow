The Stratification was our attempt to further classify suburban and urban areas by delineating based on urban reflectance from satellite imagery and road pattern from PennDOT roads (1994). The result allowed us to identify modified land covers such as forested or herbaceous suburban and forested or herbaceous urban hoping to use these to better capture areas as wildlife habitat for more generalist species.",
