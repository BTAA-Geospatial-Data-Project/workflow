NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 3 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); and, 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters of reference DOQQs. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county. MrSID compression, with mosaic option, was used. Target values for the compression ratio are (50:1) and compression levels(9) are used.",
