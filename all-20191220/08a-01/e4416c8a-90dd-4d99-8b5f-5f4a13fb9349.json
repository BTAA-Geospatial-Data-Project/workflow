These boundaries enclose catchment areas for named streams officially recognized by the Board on Geographic Names and other unofficially named streams that flow through named hollows.

EPCAMR spatially joined PA DEP 104 Major Sheds, Act 167 Stormwater and PA River Basins layers and incorporated them into the attributes to show features as pieces of a bigger watershed (2009).",
