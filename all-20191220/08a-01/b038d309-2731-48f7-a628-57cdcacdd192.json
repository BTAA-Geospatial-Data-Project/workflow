Integrating Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) into a highly developed area such as Philadelphia requires a decentralized and creative approach to planning and design. Various tools can be implemented to accomplish this, including stormwater planters, rain gardens and green roofs. All of these tools help to reduce runoff volume and filter pollutants by intercepting stormwater runoff before it enters the City's combined sewer system. The Purpose of this data is to describe the asset both locationally and via its attributes which are extensive for a GIS dataset and which are maintained. This data will serve as a platform for planning, analysis and research at PWD.",
