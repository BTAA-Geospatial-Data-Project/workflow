This data set of 28 agricultural counties in southern Minnesota contains photographic information obtained for the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and is comprised of scanned photographs that were acquired with a precision aerial mapping camera at a nominal scale of 1:40,000 on color positive film. Acquisition was leaf-on with mature crops prior to harvest. Images have been orthorectified. NAIP imagery is quarter-quadrangle centered to provide consistent and repeatable coverage. The original imagery is in GeoTIFF format. A MrSID version is also available, developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - St. Paul District for the USDA - Farm Services Agency. This version has one or several MrSID files per county and was created by mosaicking the quarter-quads together.",
