The spreadsheets used included \"06acadlib.xls\" (academic libraries), \"plmail2006.xls\" (public libraries), and \"plbranch2006.xls\" (public branch libraries). Using street addresses from the downloaded spreadsheets, shapefiles were created using the \"Geocoding\" tool in ESRI ArcMap 9.2 and street information licensed from Tele Atlas, Dynamap/2000, v. 17.0. The shapefiles were then merged using the \"Merge\" tool in ESRI ArcToolbox.",
