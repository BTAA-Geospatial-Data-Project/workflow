The mapped stratigraphic units include selected systems, groups, and formations. Additional attributes were included from derivative products of the \"Compendium of Paleozoic rock-unit stratigraphy in Indiana\u0097a revision: Indiana Geological Survey Bulletin 59 (1986).\" The names of some groups, formations, and members on some of the maps have been updated to reflect the most recent nomenclature.",
