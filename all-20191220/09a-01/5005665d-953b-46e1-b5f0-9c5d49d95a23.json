NOTE: Redistricting of all Indiana legislative boundaries were adopted in May 2011, and will be used from 2011 through 2021. Republicans who controlled the Indiana House and Senate from the 117th General Assembly oversaw the drawing of new maps in the Spring of 2011 for all 100 state house and 50 state senate districts and Indiana's nine congressional seats. New political districts are drawn every 10 years to incorporate information from the latest U.S. Census.",
