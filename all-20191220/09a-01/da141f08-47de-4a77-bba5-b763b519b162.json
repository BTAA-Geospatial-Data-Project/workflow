There are fields for each parameter for which the water body may be impaired. These Boolean fields allow for easy legend queries on each parameter or sets of parameters. Twenty-four listed streams that are included in the data table (indicated by 0 values for Dur_id, T_meas, Rch_date) do not have topology so that they do not show in the line features and will not query from the view or with theme queries; only table queries.  All impaired streams represented by lines are contained in a separate shapefile called IMPAIRED_STREAMS_IDEM_IN. These shapefiles must be used together to view all waters listed on the 303d report.",
