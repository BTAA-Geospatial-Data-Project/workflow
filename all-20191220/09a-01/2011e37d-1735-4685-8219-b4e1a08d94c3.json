The data were derived from pre-existing INDOT basemaps and databases. Data were provided by personnel of Indiana GIS Department of Transportation (INDOT), Road Inventory. The source data provided by INDOT was an ESRI point feature class (in a file geodataase) named \"MILE_MARKERS.\" MILE_MARKERS_SYSTEM1_INDOT_IN.SHP is attributed with route numbers, and mile-marker post numbers. On November 8, 2012 mile-markers for the extension of Interstate 69 (I-69) were added to these data. Each Reference Post point Inventory is placed as to Position, Measure, and by Reference Post Name. The posts are \"names\" for known spots on the road. The names are sequentially numbered along the road. The Reference Post point Inventory is Dated as of 2006-2015.",
