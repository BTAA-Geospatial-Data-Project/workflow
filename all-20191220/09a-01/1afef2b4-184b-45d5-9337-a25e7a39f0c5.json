Joinable tables must be utilized to access readings at specific stations for specific parameters. Tables are 5 year summaries of station data.  Points represent monitoring stations within Indiana as well as within 0.5 miles of the state boundary. US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports -  \"This data set provides a location map in ARCVIEW Shapefile format of selected water quality monitoring stations for 10 bacteria-related parameters. The stations and the monitoring data are extracted from the U.S. EPA Storage and Retrieval of US Waters Parametric Data (STORET) which is contributed to by a number of organizations including federal, state, interstate agencies, universities, contractors, individuals and water laboratories. Data updates to STORET area performed weekly. Each provider of data is responsible for the data it submits to STORET. The geographic coordinates for monitoring stations were obtained using USGS 1:24,000 - 1:100,000-scale topographic map (depending on map availability).\"",
