  "dc_description_s": "INDUSTRIAL_PARKS_INDOT_IN is a point shapefile that shows industrial park locations in Indiana. It is derived from data provided by personnel of the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT).  This data set is a composite of data obtained from different sources. For some facilities, the source of locational data is unknown. For other facilities, address matching was used to obtain locations. And in some places, the centriods of zip-code areas and (or) counties are used. Consequently, points may be located several miles from the actual facility. Therefore, this data set is intended for general use only, and is not intended to replace an on-the-ground survey.",
