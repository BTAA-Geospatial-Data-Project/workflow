  "dc_description_s": "EARTHQUAKE_EPICENTERS_IN.SHP shows the locations of all known historical earthquakes in Indiana with a moment magnitude (Mw) greater than or equal to 3.0. It includes earthquake locations derived from both instrumented recordings and estimations from historical accounts. The shapefile is an amalgam of points created from the CEUS SSC catalog maintained by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (up to December 31, 2008) and the U.S. Geological Survey, National Earthquake Information Center (three events on December 30, 2010, January 26, 2012, and May 10, 2012). Values of Moment Magnitude (Mw) are used in this data. Mw refers to the energy released by the event, which is proportional to the slip on a fault multiplied by the area of the fault surface that slips. Events below Mw 3.0 have been omitted, as those events are below the energies felt by humans. Also, all pre-shock and aftershock, non-tectonic (e.g., mine blast), and duplicate event entries have been omitted. Data attributes include event date and time, x-y coordinate locations, and Moment Magnitude (Mw) values.",
