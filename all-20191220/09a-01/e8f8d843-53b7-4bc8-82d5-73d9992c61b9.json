Attribute data specify the intermodal connections at each facility; i.e., the modes involved in the transfer, the AAR reporting marks of the railroad serving the facility, the type of cargo (always containers/trailers), and the direction of the transfer.\u0094 Attributes are largely from 1996-97. Because of the frequent turnover of this type of facility, some of the terminals included in the database may now be dormant or permanently closed.\"",
