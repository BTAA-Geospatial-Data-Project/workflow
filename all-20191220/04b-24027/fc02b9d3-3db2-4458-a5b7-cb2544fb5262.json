  "dc_description_s": "In 1991, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Forest Conservation Act. This law requires local jurisdictions to reduce the number of forested acres cleared when land is developed for residential, commercial or industrial use.  Howard County\u2019s Forest Conservation Program was implemented in 1993 to meet the mandates set forth in that act.  To date, thousands of acres of forests across Howard County have been protected in perpetuity through the creation of hundreds of forest conservation easements.  Although some of these are located on public land, many are located on private property.  The easements require that the owners manage the forests to insure its long-term survival and function. The layer is attributed with project number, subdivision name, f-number, area ID, lot number, acres, plat reference, origin and coordinates. The Howard County Forest Conservation areas are of exact locations, as depicted by various polygons within Howard County Maryland.",
