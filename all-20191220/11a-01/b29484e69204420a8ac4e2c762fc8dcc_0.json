Geodetic control monuments or markers make up a network of stable, identifiable points with published datum values derived from observations. This layer includes markers set by numerous organizations over the past century, with the earliest makers being set by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS) in 1934 and the most recent being set by the Stark County Engineer (SCE) in 2011. Most of the points are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83); released in 1986. The attribute table includes detailed information on the spatial location of each point.",
