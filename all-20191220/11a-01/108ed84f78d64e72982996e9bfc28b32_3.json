  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains point features that represent Railroad Crossings in Central Ohio. Each highway-rail or pathway crossing is assigned a unique alphanumeric seven digit identifier by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) as a part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. This unique identifier is stored in a national database that can be used to quickly retrieve information about the physical and operating characteristics of both public and private crossings. In addition, this information can be used by Emergency Personnel to quickly and accurately locate calls for service. This unique identifier is commonly referred to as a Railroad Crossing ID or FRA Number. Each Railroad Crossing must have this number posted on a metal plate at each crossing. Many crossings have a sign that includes the name of the railroad and an emergency contact telephone number in addition to the Railroad Crossing ID.This information can be retrieved remotely from the Federal Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Analysis' website at: http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/OfficeofSafety/PublicSite/Crossing/Crossing.aspx",
