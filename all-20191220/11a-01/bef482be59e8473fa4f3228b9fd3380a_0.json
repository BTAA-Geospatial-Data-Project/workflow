The ditches in this layer were digitized from old-paper maps and were spatially adjusted to better align with their respective features. The information in the attribute table was derived from a separate document containing numerical IDs, names, and record information like the date recorded and the volume/page where the dedication can be located. Any information missing from the attribute table reflects that the respective data was missing from that separate document. For ditches with dates recorded over several years, the final date of completion is what is listed in the attribute table.",
