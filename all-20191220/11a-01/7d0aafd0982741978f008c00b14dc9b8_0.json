The data is aggregated to Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ). Methodology is in the process of being documented and will be available as part of the 2020 Metropolitan Transportation Plan. The land use model that generates these forecasts uses a combination of census data, building permits, existing and future land use (based on local comprehensive plans), local development knowledge, employment data, environmental constraints and various weights and criteria to estimate change over time in 5 year increments. Communities were given the opportunity to review data during the process.The employment data we recieve has non-disclosure agreements, so numbers have been rounded and in some cases supressed. This is the nature of this data and we are not allowed to share it at smaller geographies.",
