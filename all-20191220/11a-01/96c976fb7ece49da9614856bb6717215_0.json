  "dc_description_s": "The areas in this data set illustrate the eligibility of streams in the area for a nationwide 401 permit. Three categories are identified, eligible, ineligible, and possibily eligible, with additional field screening required. Categories of Eligibility: Eligible for Coverage under Nationwide Permits (NWP): Areas with no shading. Other terms and conditions may apply. Ineligible for Coverage under NWPs: Projects affecting high quality streams and undesignated streams draining directly to high quality streams, as represented in the map, must undergo individual 401 review process. While quality of undesignated streams within these designated catchments is unknown, we do know that impacts to these upstream waters could affect the known high quality receiving stream. As such, an individual WQC would be required, including a complete antidegradation review allowing for public comment. Possibly Eligible for Coverage under NWP - Additional Field Screening Procedures Required:Projects affecting undesignated streams within those HUC12 watersheds that do not directly but eventually drain into high quality waters, might be eligible for coverage under Ohio certification of NWPs depending on the results of an abbreviated field screening assessment. To reproduce the colors of the online map layer use these values and colors: Ineligible: Value = 1, color (R:197 G:0 B:255); Possibly Eligible: Value = 2, color (R:255 G: 255 B:115); Eligible: Value = 3, color: no color, transparent. Color values are RGB (Red, Green, Blue).",
