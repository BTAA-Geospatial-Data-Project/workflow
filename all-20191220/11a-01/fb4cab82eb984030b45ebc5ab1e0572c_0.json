This data was downloaded in May, 2019, and clipped the extent of the county boundary. This version of the NHD was last updated in 2016.The High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) provides a hydrologic framework of the United States' surface water drainage network. This layer displays the key features of the High Resolution NHD including streams and rivers, waterbodies and other area features and points features such as sinks, waterfalls, gauging stations, wells, and springs.The NHD was created through collaboration between the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). USGS is currently responsible for updating and maintaining the NHD. This layer is of the high-resolution NHD, which was created at a scale of 1:24,000 to enhance the original NHD, which was created at a scale of 1:100,000.",
