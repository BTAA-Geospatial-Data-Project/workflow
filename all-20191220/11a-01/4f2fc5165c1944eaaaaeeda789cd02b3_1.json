To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. This data is updated, as needed, on a continual basis.",
