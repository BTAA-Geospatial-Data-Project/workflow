  "dc_description_s": "Data updated daily between midnight and 6 am.The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination. To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. This methodology is applied to all Great Lakes intakes. This data is updated, as needed, on a continual basis.",
