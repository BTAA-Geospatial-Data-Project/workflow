The final coverages for each county were then assembled by the Iowa Geological & Water Survey. All rock units that were denoted at the surface and within 30\" of the surface dependent upon soil type for the individual counties were filtered respectively and combined into a composite coverage depicting the distribution of bedrock exposures across Iowa. This polygon coverage was then intersected with the bedrock geologic map to categorize the exposures to the geologic bedrock outcrop map units.",
