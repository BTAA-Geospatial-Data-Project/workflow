Some waterbodies have had multiple treatments (i.e., reclamation events). Lake and river polygons are symbolized by the number of different treatment events the waterbody has had (see attribute [RECLAM_APPS]).  Additional attributes for each event are found in a related table (below).  Related table:   <i>water_fisheries_reclamation_events_relate </i> Attributes include:  treatment date, species targeted, method used, chemical(s) applied and project cost  To access related table records: <li>Open the layer attribute table and select a lake polygon record</li> <li>From the <i>Related Table dropdown (2nd icon on bar just above table)</i>, choose table reclamation events: to event by year</li>       <li> The related table will open and the corresponding records for the selected lake will be highlighted.</li>         <li>Note:  You can also select records from the related table and find the lakes that correspond to those records by reversing the process above (i.e., Choose <i>Related Tables dropdown (2nd icon)</i>, choose table reclamation events: Back to reclaimed lakes) </li>  The user can also access the related records by clicking on the lake of interest with the Identify Tool and expanding the related tabular information.",
