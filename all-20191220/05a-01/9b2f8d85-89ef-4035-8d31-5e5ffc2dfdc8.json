It was developed as a geographical representation of the boundaries of local general sales and use tax rates in Minnesota.   The data is updated each quarter as boundaries change and local jurisdictional units add or discontinue the implementation of local general sales and use taxes. This resource will always include the current quarter's taxing area boundaries. Updates are published thirty days in advance of the beginning of the quarter.   This dataset DOES NOT include special local taxes that may exist (lodging, entertainment, liquor, admissions and restaurant taxes).
