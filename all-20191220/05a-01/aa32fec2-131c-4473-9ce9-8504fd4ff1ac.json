At the time of the Bell System breakup, Bell operating companies were restricted to operations within specific areas called LATAs. Wire centers or 'wire center serving area', refers to the area to which local service is provided by one or more switches located at a single point. The wire center serving area is often the same area as the exchange, but a wire center can be equal to a portion of an exchange or to several exchanges combined.  The data was compiled in cooperation with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and the Minnesota incumbent local exchange carriers. The dataset was republished in June 2016 to correct the \"FROZEN\" attribute for the Blackduck Exchange.",
