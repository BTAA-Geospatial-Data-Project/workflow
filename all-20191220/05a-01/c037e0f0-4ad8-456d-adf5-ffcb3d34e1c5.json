  "dc_description_s": "Street name is the common name given to a piece of roadway. It usually matches the signed roadway name. Only county roads, state aid routes, and highways can have different street names along the same Route_ID. For other route systems each street name gets a separate Route_ID. Legacy data transferred from old Transportation Information System (TIS) may be exceptions to this rule. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one saying Non Measured in the tittle which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured in the tittle has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. Check other metadata records in this package for more information on street names",
