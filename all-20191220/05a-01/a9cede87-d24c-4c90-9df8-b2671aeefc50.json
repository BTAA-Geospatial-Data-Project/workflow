Transit Link is the Metropolitan Council sponsored small bus dial-a-ride service for the general public, where regular route transit service is not available. (ADA service is provided by Metro Mobility, see table ADAService.dbf.)  Transit Link service was implemented in 2010, replacing a system of community based Dial-a-Ride programs.   This table can be joined to the \"Counties and Cities & Townships, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area\" spatial dataset using the COCTU_CODE field (concatenation of 3-digit FIPS county code and 5-digit FIPS place code).  This will allow users to create maps and conduct spatial analyses with the data in this table.",
