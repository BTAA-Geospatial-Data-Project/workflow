The roads are attributed with information based on their designated route. Minnesota Scenic Bypass represents road centerlines for all public roads within the State of Minnesota which are designated as scenic byways in State statute. The roads are attributed with information based on their designated route. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in Non Measured which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. Check other metadata records in this package for more information on Memorial and Scenic Bypass.",
