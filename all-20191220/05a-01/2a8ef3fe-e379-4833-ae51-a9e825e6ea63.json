These include fires not only on state lands, but also rural private lands for which there is not another agency with primary responsibility. Wildfires that are not included in this layer are those that occur on federal and native American lands (several hundred annually) and those that are responded to by local fire departments (several thousand annually). DNR wildfire suppression responsibility is heaviest in the forested part of the state.  The sup_cost data is most reliable for 2017 fires and after. Suppression costs for fires prior to 2017 should be considered an estimate and are not comparable with costs for more recent fires. Similarly, for fires not marked as status = Complete, information should be considered preliminary.",
