Forests in northern and central Minnesota were surveyed except northwestern St. Louis County and most of Koochiching County. Forests in Goodhue, Wabasha, Olmsted, Winona, Fillmore, and Houston counties were also surveyed. Only forest disturbances were mapped if they were occurring at the time of the flight. Oak wilt was not assessed. Flights occurred sporadically from early June to mid-October. The following were the most common disturbers, listed from largest area disturbed to smallest area disturbed: spruce budworm,  eastern larch beetle, forest tent caterpillar, larch casebearer, abiotic cause of aspen decline, arborvitae leafminer, flooding, wind, emerald ash borer, twolined chestnut borer, heavy seed production on red maples, fire, bark beetles on pine, and jack pine budworm. Not included in this dataset are unknown causes of damage.",
