Nine land use/land cover classes, interpreted from high altitude air photos, are recorded for each 40-acre parcel in the state. These classes include: forested; cultivated; water; marsh; urban residential; extractive; pasture and open; urban non-residential or mixed residential; and transportation.  MLMIS data sets were created by grid cell coding a value for each 40-acre parcel in the state. The file was later subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells and spatially corrected to provide improved geographic reference. However, this processing step does not improve on the 40-acre resolution of the original data set.",
