The data set contains locational data and limited attributes for all MPCA stream chemistry stations, MPCA lake monitoring stations, MPCA stream biology stations, MPCA permitted dischargers [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits], and (locations only) of USGS stream flow stations. MPCA lake and stream monitoring stations are the same stations found in MPCA's EQuIS database.",
