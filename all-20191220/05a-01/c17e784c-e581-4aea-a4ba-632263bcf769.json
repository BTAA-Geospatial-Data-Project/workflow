The Metropolitan Council downloaded this data from the Census Bureau's FTP site and added a few attributes, then created block, block group, tract, county subdivision (city), county, taz and water datasets from the original data.  For block level data, this is the Census Bureau's March 2012 re-release with additional attributes added by the Met Council.",
