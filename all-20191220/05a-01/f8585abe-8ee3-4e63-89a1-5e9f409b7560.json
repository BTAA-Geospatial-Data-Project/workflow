The ability to assess the biological condition of a lake plant community is a valuable tool in the conservation of Minnesota's lakes. With this objective in mind, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed a lake plant index of biological integrity (IBI) to measure the response of a lake plant community to eutrophication. This <i>Lake Plant Eutrophication IBI</i> is used by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) to determine if a lake is meeting the federal Clean Water Act standards with regard to aquatic life use. The MPCA will use this IBI to identify lakes that are impaired (i.e., not supporting aquatic life use based on the stress received from anthropogenic eutrophication).  For a detailed description of criteria used, see: <a href=\"Lake Plant Eutrophication IBI summary 20160623.pdf\" target=_blank>Lake Plant Eutrophication IBI summary 20160623.pdf</a>",
