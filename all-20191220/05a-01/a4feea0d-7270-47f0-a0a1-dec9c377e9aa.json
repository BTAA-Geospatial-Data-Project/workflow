  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows the Fish IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) Scores for MN lakes as calculated by DNR Fisheries.  Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher biotic integrity.  Attributes correspond to the <U>most recent IBI survey</u> for each lake.  An <i>IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity)</i> is a biologically-based, multi-metric method for measuring the integrity of aquatic systems.  Minnesota DNR Fisheries Research has developed a fish-based lake IBI that incorporates fish data collected by various methods (trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seines, and backpack electrofishing units) into 8-15 metrics in three categories:  species richness, community assemblage, and trophic composition  <i>(see Section 5: Attributes)</i>.  Each metric represents an aspect of the biological assemblage structure, function, or other measurable characteristic that changes in some predictable way with increased human-induced stress. Fish IBI scores respond to differences in land use patterns, trophic state, and aquatic vegetation.  Validation studies indicate that the fish-based lake IBI scores function as a measure of fish community response to human disturbance across a gradient of lakes.  Continuing work by DNR Fisheries will expand the application of this IBI to more lake types and will validate this tool as a viable method for assessing lake impairment as part of Minnesota's 303(d) <i>Impaired Waters</i> assessments.  These scores should be considered as '<u>preliminary</u>' and are subject to change as the IBI tools are further developed and refined. This dataset only includes lakes over 100 acres and within lake classes 20-43, with few exceptions for lakes very close to 100 acres.   Additional scores will be added to this dataset annually.    For more reference information, see  <i>(Section 5: Attributes -- Detailed Citation)</i>.
