Alignments represent existing or proposed bicycle paths and bike corridors represent areas where bicycle path alignments are yet to be determined.  Both corridor and alignment layers can be classified into tiers. Tier 1 Alignments/Corridors have higher priorities than Tier 2 Alignments/Corridors.",
