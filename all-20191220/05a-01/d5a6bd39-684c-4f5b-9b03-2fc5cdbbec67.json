The lakes are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). MPCA adds additional lakes. Since the impaired lakes are a small subset of the NHD lakes, only that subset is included in the dataset.   This dataset includes impaired lakes which have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA, as well as those lakes that have a US EPA approved TMDL plan.",
