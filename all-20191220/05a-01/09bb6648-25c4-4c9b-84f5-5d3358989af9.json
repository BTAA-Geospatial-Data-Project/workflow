  "dc_description_s": "A two-dimensional representation of all streams within the State of Minnesota, with associated attributes. This data set is built on the 24,000 National Hydrography Dataset. Streams are segmented into reaches based on hydrological, physical, and political boundaries. Each individual reach has a unique ID consisting of the HUC8+three digits. These are Water Unit IDs, or WIDs (formerly known as Assessment Unit IDs (AUIDs)). These WIDs are the reference the MN Pollution Control Agency uses to support monitoring, assessment, permitting, and restoration work.   This dataset is subject to annual change. WIDs are not permanent IDs, and the extent of a reach is subject to change over time, influenced by factors such as water quality standards, channelization or restoration work, hydrological influence, and others reasons that influence how MPCA conducts water quality work. If the extent of a reach is changed, the WID number will also change. Historical associations are maintained by MPCA. Without a specific agency interest associated have an ID of '*HUC8*-999'. As the MPCA programs associate stations or attributes with these unspecificed waters, new WIDs will be assigned.",
