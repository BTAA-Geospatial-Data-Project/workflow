These lakes were identified by the University of Minnesota and Minnesota DNR Fisheries Research (Xing Fang, Liping Jiang, Peter C. Jacobson, Heinz G. Stefan, Shoeb R. Alam & Donald L. Pereira (2012): Identifying Cisco Refuge Lakes in Minnesota under Future Climate Scenarios, Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 141:6, 1608-1621). They are deep and clear enough that they will still provide suitable coldwater fish habitat even after significant climate warming. Cisco refuge lakes are classified as Tier 1 (the deepest and coldest with exceptional coldwater fish habitat - predicted TDO3<11 degrees C) and Tier 2 (less deep and cold, but still suitable coldwater habitat - predicted TDO3>11 and <17 degrees C).",
