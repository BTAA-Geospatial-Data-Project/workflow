The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county Twin Cities metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances.  Rules regulating the MRCCA were published on December 27, 2016 and became effective January 4, 2017.  The rules establish six districts, each with dimensional standards for river setbacks (among other things). The SIZ is defined as the land located between the ordinary high water level (OHWL) of public waters and a line parallel to it at a setback of 50 percent of the required structure setback. The structure setback and SIZ varies by district and river.  This shapefile delineates the physical boundaries of the SIZ in the six districts.",
