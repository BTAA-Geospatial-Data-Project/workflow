When boundaries change, new layers will be created to reflect the new boundaries.- Public = YAbstractThis layer shows 2012 United States Congressional Districts established by redistricting from 2010 census after the Supreme Court unanimously approved the Legislative Reapportionment Commission's 2012 Revised Final Plan on May 08, 2013. The state of Pennsylvania is divided into 18 Congressional Districts. Currently, the city has or is part of 3 United States Congressional Districts.
