The data was adopted on April 8, 2010, as part of the Countywide Comprehensive Plan update. The Plan was amended September 13, 2012. The areas are reflective of the April 2010 parcel data and are areas of development types such as Agricultural/Rural, Open Space, Residential, and Commercial. This data is for display purposes only. This data should be used in conjunction with the other Comprehensive Land Use Plan layers in order to fully understand and properly represent the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The Highway Plan is part of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and is not reflective of the Master Transportation Plan. The line work indicates both existing and proposed roads throughout Frederick County. The existing road networks were digitized using the most current centerlines available at the time of creation. The proposed roads are approximate lines for display purposes and do not reflect exact future road network locations. This data is for display purposes only and should be used in conjunction with the other Comprehensive Land Use Plan layers in order to fully understand and properly represent the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.",
