These data sets, which include the Comprehensive Land Use Plan Designations, Community Facilities, Highway Plan, and Community Growth Boundaries, should be used together in order to fully represent and understand how Frederick County may grow within the next 20-30 years. Using the individual layers alone may misrepresent the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The most recent Countywide Comprehensive Plan was adopted on April 8, 2010. This data is not a reflection of current ground conditions nor should it be used for engineering or surveying purposes. The Community Growth Boundaries indicate areas where residential and commercial development should take place. The data was adopted as part of the April 2010 Countywide Comprehensive Plan. The Areas were amended September 13, 2012. This data should be used in conjunction with the other Comprehensive Land Use Plan layers in order to fully understand and properly represent the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. This data is for display purposes only.",
