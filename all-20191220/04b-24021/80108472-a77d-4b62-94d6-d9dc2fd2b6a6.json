Unlike the other preservation programs, Rural Legacy easements are concentrated in certain approved Rural Legacy areas. There is one Rural Legacy area in Frederick County, in the Myersville-Burkittsville region. A second Rural Legacy Area is located in the Adamstown Region and is called the Carrollton Manor Rural legacy Area. The Rural Legacy Program establishes permanent easements. There is no 5-year District Agreement. The Rural Legacy program also differs from other land preservation programs in that it takes factors such as cultural and natural resources into consideration (as well as agricultural resources).",
