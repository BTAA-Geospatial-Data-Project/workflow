The Critical Farms Program was established to help farmers purchase more farmland by loaning\" money. The farm of interest is evaluated and a percentage (75%) of the easement value is given to the farmer to assist in the mortgage or payment. Once a farmer is in the Critical Farms Program, he or she must apply to the MALPF Program. Applicants must attempt to sell an easement to MALPF for 5 years, if they are not successful they can either pay back the Critical Farms funding and get out of land preservation, or they can establish an easement and keep the Critical Farms \"loan\". If they are successful in selling their easement to MALPF, they will be funded for it through MALPF, however they have to repay back the Critical Farms \"loan\".",
