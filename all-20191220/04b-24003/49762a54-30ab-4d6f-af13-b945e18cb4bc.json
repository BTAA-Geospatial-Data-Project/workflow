Open water is captured at the water line\u2019s edge and does not have coincident geometry with other feature classes. Features that are less than 500 square feet in area and ornamental ponds are not captured. Streams and creeks that are wider than 10 feet are captured as open water polygons. Drainage connectors are used to represent the centerline of the water body when appropriate to maintain the hydraulic network. Stormwater ponds are not captured.Domain values for this feature include OPEN WATER.",
