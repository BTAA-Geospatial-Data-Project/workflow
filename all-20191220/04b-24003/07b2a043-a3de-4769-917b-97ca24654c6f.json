The bridge polygon includes the bridge surface area from expansion joint to expansion joint where each meets land and all other sides are captured at its outer extents to form a complete polygon. Road features are captured through the bridge polygon so that the road network will be continuous and can overlap bridge polygons. All County maintained bridges and bridges over water or other structures greater than 20 feet in length are captured. Domain values for this feature include BRIDGE and OVERPASS.",
