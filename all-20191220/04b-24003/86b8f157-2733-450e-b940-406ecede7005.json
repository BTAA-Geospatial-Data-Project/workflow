This map layer was manually digitized using heads-up processes. Planimetric data acquired by the county via the 2014 aerial imagery was used as a basis for this update. Patio/deck features not captured in the 2011 planimetrics were added, as well as any major changes. Features that no longer exist on the ground were deleted. This task was derived from the 2014 Maryland Statewide Aerial Photography Project imagery, which has a 6-inch pixel resolution. The imagery acquisition was conducted in 2014 (Leaf off conditions) and the imagery Meets ASPRS Class 1 standards at map scale 1:1200 (1\u201d = 100\u2019). The Minimum Mapping Unit for this layer is 100 square feet.OIT GIS removed pool features less than 175 sq feet. This was done because many backyard trampolines were incorrectly captured as pools.",
