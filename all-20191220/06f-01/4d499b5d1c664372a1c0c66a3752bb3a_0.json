  "dc_description_s": "The Michigan Carpool Parking Lot Program (sometimes referred to as Park and Ride) began as a pilot program in 1974 with 11 carpool parking lots. Today there are over 240 carpool parking lots located across the state providing nearly 9,000 parking spaces. In addition to lots owned and maintained by MDOT, the Meijer Corporation has partnered with MDOT to provide carpool parking at several of their stores. Please see the MDOT Metadata Form for additional information. Update Cycle: Carpool lots are added and updated as needed when new lots are constructed or removed. Coverage: This inventory shows all MDOT owned and operated carpool lots in Michigan along with several Meijer parking lots that provide carpool parking in partnership with MDOT. Contact: Kami Brown",
