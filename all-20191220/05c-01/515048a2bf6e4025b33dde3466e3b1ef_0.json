On December 7, 2018, the Minneapolis City Council directed staff to submit a final draft of Minneapolis 2040 to the Metropolitan Council for their review. It is expected that the Metropolitan Council will complete their review in the first half of 2019, with the Minneapolis City Council taking final action on the Plan shortly thereafter. The guidance described in this layer will likely change as part of that review and final action, and this layer will subsequently be updated accordingly. The future land use and built form maps of Minneapolis 2040 are not yet adopted City policy, but this data that informs those maps has been provided here for ease of access related to various requests for this information. The Future Land Use and Built Form Maps are the primary tools for implementing the Land Use and Built Form policies of the Comprehensive Plan. They also embody and implement policies found throughout Minneapolis 2040, as well as the fourteen Comprehensive Plan Goals. The Future Land Use Map guides land use for every parcel in the city. Any changes to the use of land must be consistent with the guidance of the Future Land Use Map. The Built Form Map guides the scale of development for every parcel in the city through Built Form Districts. The built form of all new and remodeled buildings must be consistent with the guidance of the Built Form Map. This layer contains parcel level data regarding Future Land Use and Built Form guidance from Minneapolis 2040.",
