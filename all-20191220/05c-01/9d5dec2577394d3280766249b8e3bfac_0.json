On December 7, 2018, the Minneapolis City Council directed staff to submit a final draft of Minneapolis 2040 to the Metropolitan Council for their review. It is expected that the Metropolitan Council will complete their review in the first half of 2019, with the Minneapolis City Council taking final action on the Plan shortly thereafter. The guidance described in this layer will likely change as part of that review and final action, and this layer will subsequently be updated accordingly. The future land use and built form maps of Minneapolis 2040 are not yet adopted City policy, but this data that informs those maps has been provided here for ease of access related to various requests for this information. Goods and Services Corridors serve two purposes within the Minneapolis 2040 Future Land Use Map. They indicate where commercial uses should front in relation to properties guided for commercial future land uses. They also identify where the establishment or expansion of commercial uses can be considered. Properties immediately adjacent to a Goods and Services Corridor may be considered for commercial activity, allowing for uses similar in scale and scope to the Neighborhood and Corridor Mixed Use categories.
