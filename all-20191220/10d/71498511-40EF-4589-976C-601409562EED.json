  "dc_description_s": "This data layer represents hydrography for Douglas County, Wisconsin in 2014. This shapefile includes all line features (arcs) in the 1:24,000-scale Hydrography data model (Version 6). The arcs are attributed to easily define themes based on cartographic or modeling needs. Arc attributes include feature names and Water Body ID Codes (WBICs). The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed this statewide Hydrography geographic data layer from 1:24,000-scale sources. The 1:24K Hydrography database includes information about surface water features represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and so on. A large portion of the DNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Wetlands delineations are NOT included in the 24K Hydro data layer. Following the initial release of the 24K Hydrography database in October of 2000, a series of data updates and enhancements have culminated in Version 6 of the 24K Hydro layer, which was completed in June 2007. Version 6 includes data enhancements and corrections.]",
