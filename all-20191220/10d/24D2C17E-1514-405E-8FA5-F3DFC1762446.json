[Buildings represent a collection of points spatially located over the main building for any given address. For the most part, in urban areas, there is not a building point located unless the main building would not be physically visible from the road. The data was developed to only show the main structure for a given address, meaning that there is only one building point per address. In the case of duplexes or multi family structures additional building points and site access points are added. By only having one building point per address and one site access point, a one to one relationship is maintained with the site access point.]",
