These maps give insight to what the landscape of Wisconsin looked like at a time of peak deforestation and land abandonment in addition to how this legacy has impacted the current landscape. Furthermore, these maps offer a tool for future landscape management including but not limited to; shore line changes, erosion, reforestation, and wetland restoration. Included in this geodatabase are: economic natural features (points); land use-land cover (polygons); transportation & water infrastructure (lines).A user guide for this data may be found here:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVG-39Kw1Edmsw315vXf-DUWdw2qXEGEBYKpewCkHyw/edit (The user guide is also included as a PDF file with the data upon download.)",
