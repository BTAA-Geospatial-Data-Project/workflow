[Zoning: The zoning layer depicts the zoning information for each civil town in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin as well as several of the villages and City of Fond du Lac. Each civil town/village/city in Fond du Lac County controls its own zoning. The County Land Information Department maps the zoning for the towns and several villages. The City of Fond du Lac maps their zoning independently, but also provides their information to the County on an annual basis. Each town/village/city is asked to provide documentation of any change in their zoning in order to update this data.Zoning_Airport: This layer determines height restrictions around the airport. The difference between ground elevation and the limit elevation in the attribute table determines the maximum height of surrounding structures. Last change to this occurred 2/10/1997.]",
