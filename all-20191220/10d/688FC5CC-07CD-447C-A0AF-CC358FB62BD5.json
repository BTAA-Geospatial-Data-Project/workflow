[Tax parcel map of Waupaca County, Wisconsin. The layer was derived from a variety of source maps including: mylar county parcel maps, plats of surveys, deed descriptions, subdivision maps, certified survey maps, highway right-of-way plats, and township highway right-of-way maps. These source materials were of several different scales and were from dates ranging from the early 1850's to the present. This map provides a useful representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels and is suitable for its intended purpose. It is not, however, meant to be used for the determination of land ownership or to be in any way a substitute for the land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds. The tax parcel layer is available in a county-wide or individual layer for each township, city, or village.]",
