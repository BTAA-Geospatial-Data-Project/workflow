  "dc_description_s": "This data layer represents roads for Washington County, Wisconsin in 2014. It is a feature class within the geodatabase 'Washington_Roads_2014.gdb'. [The transportation dataset includes road centerlines, address points, and related features. The data was derived from many sources. Road Centerline data was first acquired by screen digitizing roads using 1995 orthophotography. Major improvement projects were completed when new orthophotography was acquired in 2000 and again in 2005. Washington County actively maintains road centerline data for all areas except the City of West Bend. Address point data was first acquired from a variety of sources in 2006. Washington County actively maintains situs address points for all areas except the City of West Bend. The City of West Bend maintains address points and road centerlines for their municipality in a format nearly identical to that used by Washington County. The countywide dataset is obtained when combing the City and County data.]",
