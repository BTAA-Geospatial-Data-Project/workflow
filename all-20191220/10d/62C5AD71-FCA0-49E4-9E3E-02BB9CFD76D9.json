The features included in this geodatabase are 'Washburn_Buildings_2018' and 'Washburn_Driveways_2018'.[Addresses: This data set consists of digital map files containing addressing or site access information obtained primarily by conducting lab work using aerial imagery. Features contained in the data set include all site access points countywide and associated attributes. Site access points sometimes are referred to as addresses, however these data typically represent the intersection of the public road right of way and the private entrance to private property. The Washburn County plans to maintain this digital data in ESRI's ArcGIS 9.x geodatabase environment using ArcMap tools. Some of the data was developed using field data collection techniques and field data collection will be used extensively to maintain the data. There are attributes in the data documenting each record source.Driveways: This data set consists of digital map files containing driveways obtained by conducting lab work using aerial imagery. Features contained in the data set include numerous driveways that are necessary to provide information to help connect or point the way between the site access point and the primary structure.]",
