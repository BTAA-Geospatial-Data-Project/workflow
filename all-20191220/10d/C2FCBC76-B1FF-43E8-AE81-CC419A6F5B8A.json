The original vegetation cover data was digitized from a 1976 map created from land survey notes written in the mid-1800s when Wisconsin was first surveyed. Linework representing lakes and other hydrographic areas in other data sets were subsequently merged with the original vegetation cover data set to more closely match the source map.",
