Points are located at the center point of each 40-acre quarter-quarter section in which land is enrolled. Acreage enrolled from fractional or government lots are located either to the most approximate QQ, Q or S as possible. (Enrolled parcels are represented by the PLSS shape they lie within; however, the actual size of the enrolled property may be as small as 10 acres.)",
