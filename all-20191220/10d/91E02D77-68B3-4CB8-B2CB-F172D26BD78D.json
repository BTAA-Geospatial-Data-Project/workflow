It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Lincoln_Addresses_2007.gdb.[This data set consists of digital map files containing building point information obtained predominantly by conducting field work using GPS technology. Features contained in the data set include all primary building points countywide and associated attributes and annotation. Building points sometimes are referred to as addresses, however these data typically represent the location of the primary addressed structure on each parcel and correspond to a site access point and driveway to the property. On some parcels there are either no buildings or there are multiple buildings. In the case of no buildings there may be a site access point but no corresponding building point. In the case of many primary addressed structures there will be a corresponding site access point for each structure even though they may all access the property from the same location. The Lincoln County Land Information Office plans to maintain this digital data in geodatabase format in an ESRI ArcSDE environment using ArcMap tools.]",
