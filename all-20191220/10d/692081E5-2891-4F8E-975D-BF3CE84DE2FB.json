It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Buffalo_HydroLine_2017.gdb.[Flowlines include all line features from the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams etc. A large portion of the WDNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been added to the linework along with officially recognized water body names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Flowlines were created with M (measures) and Z (elevation) values to accommodate placement of user data through a linear referencing system.]",
