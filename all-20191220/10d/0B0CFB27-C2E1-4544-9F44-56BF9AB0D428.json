One of the first digital layers which are the source of today\u2019s Zoning Layer Map was completed October 28, 2013 by the North Central Regional Planning Commission. That digital layer is a compilation of those older records, information and data and is intended for reference purposes only. An important note is the Zoning Map was completed first by hand and then digitally a number of years prior to a full Parcel digital map was in place in December 2017. An ongoing effort to align the zoning maps to the parcels is being made.]",
