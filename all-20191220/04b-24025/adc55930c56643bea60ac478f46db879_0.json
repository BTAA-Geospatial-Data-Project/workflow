The Department of Planning Zoning is a repository for FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and offers assistance in making floodplain determinations and understanding flood insurance requirements. Land located within the 100 year floodplain has a 1% chance of being flooded in any given year, or 26% chance during the life of a mortgage, is subject to restrictive building regulations.",
