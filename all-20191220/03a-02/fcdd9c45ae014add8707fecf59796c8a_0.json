Freight needs aligned with highway freight bottlenecks identified in the 2016 Iowa State Freight Plan. A combination of INRIX travel time data and input from internal and external stakeholders was used to identify bottleneck locations. Bottlenecks were then ranked through an analysis of each location s value, condition, and performance (VCAP). Value was based on how much each location increased the efficiency of the highway network for trucks; condition was based on the Infrastructure Condition Evaluation (ICE) tool s analysis of condition and traffic data; and performance was based on the INRIX bottleneck ranking tool. Locations were ranked, with annual average truck traffic data being used as a tiebreaker. For more information, see iowadot.gov/iowainmotion.",
