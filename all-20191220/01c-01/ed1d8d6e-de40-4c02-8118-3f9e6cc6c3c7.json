See summary description (txt) file for information about intended use, projection, currency, attributes, etc.This map layer represents the City Council Districts for the City of Bloomington, Indiana. Bloomington contains six representative council districts, numbered one (1) through six (6). Boundaries are set by City ordinance. Districts are based on voting precincts and the municipal boundary. Any additional area annexed by the city are placed in council districts defined by the annexation ordinance. District boundaries may be altered by council action but done rarely other than the redistricting process that follows the Decennial US Census.
