Unlike the SHisMasterPlan feature class, this feature class does not distinguish between different cycle amendment petitions and only reflects the most current sewer master plan designation.The sewer master plan geodatabase includes a feature data set (sewerMasterPlan) containing three feature classes: SCurMasterPlan, sewerCombined and SHisMasterPlan. The feature classes participate in a topology (tsewerMasterPlan). The SCurMasterPlan feature class represents the petitions for the current cycle. The sewerCombined represents the current master plan designation within the county. The SHisMasterPlan contains all of the petitions areas from all cycles. The geodatabase includes relationship classes that associate related table containing information on assessments, councilmanic districts, election districts, lineage (feature level metadata), plan map, recommendations and zoning designations.",
