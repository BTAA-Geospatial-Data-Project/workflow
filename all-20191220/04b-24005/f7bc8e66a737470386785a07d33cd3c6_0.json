A LOMA can affect flood zone determination without a map change. The feature class was created by interpreting the information contained on each LOMA and mapping the location(s) for each of the addresses cited in the document. A PDF of the LOMA document was associated to the feature as an attachment. For addresses having more than one LOMA, only a single feature was created and additional attachments were associated to the feature. This feature class contains historical LOMA location/documents not revalidated by FEMA.",
