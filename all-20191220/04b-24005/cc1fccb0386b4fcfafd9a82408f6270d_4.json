This legislation directs State spending to Priority Funding Areas. Priority Funding Areas are existing communities and places where local governments want State investment to support future growth.Growth-related projects covered by the legislation include most State programs that encourage or support growth and development such as highways, sewer and water construction, economic development assistance, and State leases or construction of new office facilities.The Priority Funding Areas legislation builds on the foundation created by the Visions which were adopted as State policy in the 1992 Economic Growth, Resource Protection and Planning Act. Beginning October 1, 1998, the State of Maryland directed funding for projects that support growth to Priority Funding Areas. Funding for projects in municipalities, other existing communities, industrial areas, and planned growth areas designated by counties receive priority State funding over other projects. Priority Funding Areas are locations where the State and local governments want to target their efforts to encourage and support economic development and new growth.",
