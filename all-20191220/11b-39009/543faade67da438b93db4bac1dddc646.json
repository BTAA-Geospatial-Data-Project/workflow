At a 30:1 compression ratio, the resulting MrSID file size will average around 2GBs in size (dependent upon county size). MrSID Images will also be created for each buy-up county. These MrSIDs, will be compressed at a 20:1 ratio. In some cases, buy-up counties have requested a higher compression ratio.",
