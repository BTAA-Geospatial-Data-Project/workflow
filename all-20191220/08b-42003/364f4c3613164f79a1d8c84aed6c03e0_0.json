Created by 3 Rivers 2nd Nature based upon Allegheny County watershed file showing all tributaries of all streams. All tributatries draining to a single point on the river were joined as a single major stream system watershed for field measurement and analysis purposes. If viewing this description on the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center s open data portal (http://www.wprdc.org), this dataset is harvested on a weekly basis from Allegheny County s GIS data portal (http://openac.alcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/). The full metadata record for this dataset can also be found on Allegheny County s GIS portal.
