  "dc_description_s": "This dataset overlays a grid on the County to assist in locating a parcel. The grid squares are 3,500 by 4,500 square feet. The data was derived from original MAPINDX: Map Index Sheets from Block and Lot Grid of Property Assessment and based on aerial photography. Tiles are numbered in a clockwise spiral fashion starting with #1 at the point in downtown Pittsburgh. Each tile contains 16 Blocks. Each Index Sheet contains 16 lot/block sheets, labeled from left to right, top to bottom (4 across, 4 down): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S. The first (4) numeric characters in a parcelID indicate the Index sheet in which the parcel can be found, the alpha character identifies the block in which most (or all) of the property lies. If viewing this description on the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center s open data portal (http://www.wprdc.org), this dataset is harvested on a weekly basis from Allegheny County s GIS data portal (http://openac.alcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/). The full metadata record for this dataset can also be found on Allegheny County s GIS portal. You can access the metadata record and other resources on the GIS portal by clicking on the Explore button (and choosing the Go to resource option) to the right of the ArcGIS Open Dataset text below.
