  "dc_description_s": "This data set is part of the Michigan Geographic Framework. The framework serves as the digital base map for State of Michigan government. Currently the geographic framework contains features including roads, rivers, lakes, streams, railroads, political jurisdiction boundaries, school district boundaries, census area tabulation boundaries and legislative district boundaries. Specifically, this Michigan base map will consist of an Arc Info coverage which includes features and attributes based on the current TIGER/Line Files, base map features based on both the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Michigan Resource Information System (MIRIS) Files and an enhanced linear referencing system built from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) Michigan Accident Location Index (MALI). The Geographic Framework will serve as a common and standardized infrastructure on which all GIS users of 1:24,000 scale map data can build their applications. At the heart of the Geographic Framework will be the ability to administer programs that use location-based information and need to relate one database to another geographically. Version5a replaces Version4b as the current version of the Michigan Geographic Framework (MGF). A primary driving force in the creation of Framework Version 5a was the continued reconciliation of the road network and city/village boundaries with the roads and boundaries as defined on the ACT51 maps. For further information on ACT51 see: Changes incorporated in version 5a of the MGF are described in the following documents: MGF_v5a_Updates, MGF_v5a_Trunkline_Updates These and other documents related to MGF can be found at: ",
