  "dc_description_s": "Parcel boundaries are developed from deeds, plats of subdivision and other legal documents going back to the mid 1800's, following generally accepted practices used in Public Land Survey System states, and following guidelines established by the Illinois Department of Revenue and the International Association of Assessment Officials. Lake County's parcel coverage is based on resolving the accumulated evidence of all of the legal documents surrounding a particular parcel or subdivision, and not the result of a countywide resurvey. These parcel boundaries are intended to be a visual inventory of property for tax and other administrative purposes; they are not intended to be used in place of an on-site survey or for the precise determination of property corners or PLSS features based on GIS coordinates. In Illinois, only a registered professional land surveyor is authorized to determine boundary locations. Included are the tax parcel boundaries, represented as polygons and centroids, for all changes resulting from legal records submitted to the Recorder of Deeds up to December 31st of the preceding year, as well as any court orders, municipal annexations and other transactions which impact the tax parcel boundaries. NOTE: The ONLY attribute included is the Property Index Number, or PARCEL_NUM. Additional assessment attribute data can be downloaded here. This parcel layer is used for tax assessment purposes and for a variety of other local government functions. It changes often, both spatially and in its attribution, based on divisions or consolidations, the sale of property and other transactions. Example: PIN 08-17-304-014 can be interpreted as follows: Township 08, Section 17, Block 304, Parcel 014. Note that the first digit of block, 3 in this example, signifies that the parcel lies in quarter section 3. The quarter sections are labeled from 1 through 4, representing the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast quarter sections, respectively. Update Frequency: This dataset is updated on a weekly basis.",
