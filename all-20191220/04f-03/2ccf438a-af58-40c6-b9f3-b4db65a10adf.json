The boundaries of each zone was entered using ARC/INFO COGO. The associated attributes were added and the zones used to identify the potential for accidents as a guide for the intensity of development permitted based on the AICUZ Study. On November 15, 2016, the Military Installation Overlay was approved by the District Council (CR-97-2016) which includes but did not change the geographies for the accident potential zones.",
