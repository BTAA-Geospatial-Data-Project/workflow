The layer contains labels for the new critical area boundary and corresponding designations derived from shoreline and wetlands digitized from 2007/08 aerial imagery and CIR. A 1000' buffer of the shorline and wetlands generated the proposed critical area boundary. Critical area designations (IDA, LDA, RCA, - Prince George's Planning chnaged the designations to I-D-O, L-D-O, and R-C-O to correspond with local zoning values) were pulled from the current designation layer and fit to the new boundary. Extensive discussions with County officials and Critical Area Commission resulted in a complete review of designations. Planning Department staff edits: changed designation types to correspond with Planning Department Zoning values; added fields for the legislation title and date enacting the area.",
