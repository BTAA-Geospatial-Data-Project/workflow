It should be noted, however, that the full extent of all environmentally regulated features is determined during the development review process, when site-specific data is gathered for the subject property or properties. Future updates to this dataset are anticipated once the SSURGO soils data has been completed for Prince George's County (anticipated completion date: 2008). Additionally, the steep and severe slopes database should be updated based on the county's 2001 two-foot contour layer. Future legislative updates that impact the size of the stream buffers or wetland buffers would also constitute a reason for updating this layer. All streams and associated 50-foot stream buffers; wetlands and 25-foot wetland buffers; FEMA floodplain; and associated severe slopes 25% and greater. This polygon does not include steep slopes (&gt;= 15% and &lt; 25% on highly erodible soils).",
