This trail feature layer was developed using current area master plans, sector plans, approved site plans, the latest aerial photography, park master plan, trail user maps, and GPS data. The data is suitable for use at the countywide or planning area scale. The attributes associated with this layer indicate the type of facility such as existing and proposed hiker-biker-equestrian trails, natural surface trails, sidepaths, shared-use roadways, designated bike lanes, and water trails. This layer will be continually updated as new trails are constructed or as proposals are modified or added through the master plan or development review process.",
