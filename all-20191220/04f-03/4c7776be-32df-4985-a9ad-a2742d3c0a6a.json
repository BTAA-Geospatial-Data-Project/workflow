Over time, a portion or all of and active plan may be superseded. The overlapping portion of a plan boundary that is superseded by a newer plan is removed from this data set and placed into a separate feature class for research purposes. A geodatabase containing feature classes of the superseded portions of each plan, as well as the original complete plan boundary are located on the Planning Department's internal network at J:\\GIS\\Layers\\Community Plans.",
