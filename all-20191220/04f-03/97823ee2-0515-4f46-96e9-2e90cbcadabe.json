  "dc_description_s": "The Plat_Bound_Poly layer is used to locate and identify the area of plats recorded since October of 1999. It is also used to identify subdivided areas in the property layer that the M_NCPPC GIS staff have captured or re-captured using the current method relying on COGO and plat survey information. Several hundred plats recorded prior to October of 1999 have been recaptured in this fashion due to planning needs or simply to improve the cartographic accuracy of the property layer. The Plat_Bound_Poly layer is maintained as part of the property dataset by the M-NCPPC GIS staff. Constraints on accessing and using the data: The Plat_Bound_Poly layer contains the areas of change affected by recorded plats, old and new, that have been captured or re-captured in their entirety by the M-NCPPC GIS staff. That staff has captured plats recorded since 10/4/99 (plat 187-099) as well as several hundred older recorded plats. The vast majority of older plats are not represented in this layer, nor is it likely they will ever be captured. Further, plat boundary shapes are subject to removal or alteration by subsequent actions such as vacations or plats of resubdivision or correction.",
