These uses/structures are termed non-conforming. This has occurred in a variety of ways. In some cases, a land use was established prior to the initial zoning of the property. In other cases, a use was once permitted in a zone but has subsequently been disallowed or allowed only by a special exception. Also, there are some structures that were originally built according to all of the parking, setback, sign, etc. requirements of the ordinance but no longer meet these requirements because of a subsequent change in the regulations. The non-conforming uses and structures are considered to be grandfathered\" and allowed to remain as long as the use has never ceased for a period no longer than 180 days. In certain circumstances, uses may be required to be recertified. Any alteration, enlargement, extension or reconstruction of a non-conforming use requires approval of a special exception.\"",
