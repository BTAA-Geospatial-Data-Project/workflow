The statewide Michigan Hydrography Framework (version ) (based upon TIGER/Line Files, including basemap features based on both MDNR MIRIS files and enhanced linear referencing system built from the Michigan Accident Location Index (MALI)) was utilized as the basis of this dataset. Lake polygons present in this layer were edited (shape, attributes, location, duplicate representations for a lake in multiple counties), created for lakes that were detemined to be missing, and adjusted to reflect our current knowledge of the waterbodies throughout the state. For each lake (~10 acres or larger), a \"New-Key\" was assigned, based upon Humphrys and Green (1962). This unique identifier serves to link these saptial representations to numerous datasets (historical, current, and future) containing information pertaining to water quality, depth, origin, etc..",
