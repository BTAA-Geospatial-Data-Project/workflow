Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These features were originally captured in 2015 and updated in 2017. The following planimetric layers were updated: - Barrier Lines- Building Polygons- Bridge and Tunnel Polygons- Curb Lines- Grate Points- Horizontal and Vertical Control Points- Hydrography Lines- Obscured Area Polygons- Railroad Lines- Recreational Areas- Road, Parking, and Driveway Polygons- Sidewalk and Stair Polygons- Swimming Pools- Water Polygons",
