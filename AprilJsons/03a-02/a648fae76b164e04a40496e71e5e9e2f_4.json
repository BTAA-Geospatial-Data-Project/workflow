  "dc_description_s": "The efficiency and safety of a highway depends largely on the amount and character of interruptions to the movement of traffic. The primary cause of these interruptions is vehicular movements to and from business, residences and other developments along the highway. Regulation and overall control of highway access are necessary to provide efficient and safe highway operation and to utilize the full potential of the highway investment. Accordingly, the Iowa DOT has established an access management policy to control access to the Primary Highway System. When right-of-way was obtained for the establishment of the primary highway system, the Iowa Department of Transportation obtained access rights that allow the DOT to restrict direct access to the primary highway. As a result, the DOT has established a functional hierarchy to prioritize the primary highway system. The District's Engineering Operations Technician (EOT) will provide the applicant details regarding the particular entrance spacing allowable.",
