  "dc_description_s": "Protected Open Space for the DVRPC Region as of 2016. DVRPC maintains an inventory of protected public and private open space in the Delaware Valley. The inventory tracks all publicly-owned open space, preserved farmland, and non profit protected open space. State, county and municipal programs preserve farms by purchasing development rights with public funds. Non-profits (land trusts and conservancies) protect privately owned open space lands by purchasing easements or by acquiring land outright with a combination of public and private funds. This file is a compilation from the following sources and is not necessarily parcel-based: Bucks County Planning Commission; Burlington County Department of Economic Development and Regional Planning; Camden County Division of Open Space and Farmland Preservation; Camden County Improvement Authority; Chester County Planning Commission; Delaware County Planning Department; Gloucester County Planning Division; Mercer County Planning Division; Montgomery County Planning Commission; Natural Lands Trust; New Jersey Conservation Foundation; New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection; New Jersey State Agriculture Development Committee; Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Philadelphia City Planning Commission; Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation In the cases where land had multiple owners, the following heirarchy was applied: 1. Preserved Farmland 2. Federal 3. State 4. County 5. Municipal 6. Nonprofit",
