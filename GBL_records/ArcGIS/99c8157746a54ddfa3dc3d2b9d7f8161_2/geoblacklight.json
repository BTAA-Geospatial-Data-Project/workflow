  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. This shoreline feature class consists of twenty separate shoreline data sets, located in Anne Arundel County, compiled from various sources, and spanning 1932-2010. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shorelines were acquired online from the 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data set (http://shoreline. noaa. gov/data/datasheets/t-sheets. html), 2) the NOAA National Shoreline data set (http://shoreline. noaa. gov/data/datasheets/index. html), and 3) the NOAA Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) data set (http://shoreline. noaa. gov/data/datasheets/cusp. html). The ca. 1940 Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) shorelines were extracted in the early 1990s from Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of NOAA. MGS digitized these shorelines directly from bromide or mylar copies of the Coastal Survey maps. The ca. 1990 MGS shorelines were digitized by EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, MD in 2000. EDI extracted the shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). This shoreline feature class was created by appending the twenty individual shoreline data sets into one master shoreline feature class file, and retains the original attribute field names from the twenty input files. As such, the original attribute information for each input dataset is part of this final shoreline feature class. MGS also created seven additional attribute fields, some which are required for DSAS analysis and some of which facilitated general data management/analysis -- DSAS_DATE, DSAS_UNC, DSAS_SRC, DSAS_DEC, DSAS_CO, DSAS_NPROJ, and DSAS_SLINF. Here is a list of the individual data sets (by source) compiled for this master shoreline feature class (all data sets clipped to county boundaries): 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data sets -- CM7202; 2) NOAA National Shoreline data sets -- CS288, MD1932A1, MD1932A2, MD1932A3, MD1932B, MD1933D, MD1933E, MD1933F, MD1934A, CS307, MD1941A1, PH6008, PH6009A, PH6609, CM7415, and CM7601; 3) MGS data sets -- 1940 and 1990 MGS shoreline; and 4) NOAA CUSP data set.
