  "dc_description_s": "The DVRPC Freight Rail Line data layer was developed to identify key ownership and operation details for freight rail lines in the Delaware Valley. This data set was developed internally using various rail mapping and track chart sources. The polyline network represents rights-of-way rather than track and is segmented based on subdivision or track name as well as key profile details. The line set has been developed with input from various Class I and short-line railroads in the region.",
