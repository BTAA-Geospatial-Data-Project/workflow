  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility consists of linear features which specifically show public roadways that are eligible for Federal funding in the State of Maryland. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is key to understanding which public roadways are eligible for Federal funding in the State of Maryland.Roadway Federal Aid Eligibility data is updated and published on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2016.'Last Updated: 11/2017'For data information, contact the'MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring SystemEmail:''TMS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information, contact the'MDOT SHA Geospatial TechnologiesEmail:''GIS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):http://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):http://roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspxMDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
