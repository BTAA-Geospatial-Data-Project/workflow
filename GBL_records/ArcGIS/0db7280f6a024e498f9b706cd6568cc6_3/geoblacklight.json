  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD).Roadway Functional Classification'data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Functional Classification data is key to understanding the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout Maryland's network of highways.Roadway'Functional Classification data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year.
