  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This layer is the UTM 6x8 zone that covers Zone 18S which covers part of Maryland. The U. S. National Grid provides a standardized grid reference system that is seamless across jurisdictional boundaries and allows for pinpointing exact locations. Since USNG is standardized, it can be understood and used as a common geographic framework for response. Zone 18S covers part of Maryland. The vertical UTM boundaries are horizontal latitude band boundaries form (generally) 6 X 8 Grid Zones. Hence, the first three letters of the MGRS value, e. g. 18S , are referred to as the Grid Zone Designator (GZD). The fourth and fifth characters are a pair of letters identifying one of the 100,000-meter grid squares within the grid zone (or UPS area). The S in this instance is not to be confused with UTM Zone 18S for UTM in the Southern Hemisphere. There are no classification restrictions on this information. This information was created by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Coordinate Systems Analysis Team (SNAC). Last Updated: 01/2016",
