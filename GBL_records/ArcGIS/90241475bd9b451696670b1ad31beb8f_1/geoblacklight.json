  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The dataset displays the presence and absence of forested areas within a 100 foot-buffer of a stream or waterbody. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) stream layer developed by the United States Geological Survey was buffered 100-feet on each side of the stream centerline to determine stream buffers in Maryland. A shoreline file developed by the Maryland State Highway Administration was buffered 100-feet to determine the shoreline buffer in Maryland. The resulting buffer layers were clipped with a forest cover layer to determine the presence and absence of forest in those buffers. The forest cover layer was derived from a tree canopy layer developed by the Community College of Baltimore County, Catonsville, Geography Department. The tree canopy was developed using 2007 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) color infra-red 1-meter imagery. To determine areas forested, contiguous areas of tree cover less than 1 acre were removed from the dataset and then used for clipping the stream and shoreline buffers. Last Updated: 2010",
