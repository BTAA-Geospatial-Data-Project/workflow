  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. In 1997, the Maryland General Assembly approved the Rural Legacy Program as a major component of Governor Glendening's Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Initiative. The purpose of the Rural Legacy Program is to protect Maryland's best remaining rural landscapes and natural areas through the purchase of land or conservation easements. Funds are awarded by grants to sponsors to purchase fee simple interests or easements on property within a Rural Legacy Area. This file consists of properties that have been protected using Rural Legacy funds. Last Updated: 03/23/2016",
