  "dc_description_s": "The intent of the dataset is to provide a single, comprehensive, statewide road centerlines data set to serve the needs of the entire New Jersey GIS user community. These enhanced data support complex geocoding, multiple linear referencing systems and provide robust cartographic options.  The New Jersey Office of Information Technology (OIT), Office of GIS (OGIS) has enhanced the previously published NJ Department of Transportation (DOT) Roadway Network GIS data set to create a fully segmented Road Centerlines of New Jersey feature class. This dataset includes fully parsed address information and additional roadway characteristics. It provides the geometric framework for display and query of relevant non-spatial data published as separate tables that can be joined to the feature class. The enhancement process included integration of multiple data sets, primarily those developed and maintained by county agencies in New Jersey and the US Census Bureau. Direct Metadata Link",
