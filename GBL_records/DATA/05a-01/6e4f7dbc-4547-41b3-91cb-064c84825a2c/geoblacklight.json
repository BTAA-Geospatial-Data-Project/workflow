  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset is a detailed (1-acre minimum), hierarchically organized vegetation cover map produced by computer classification of combined two-season pairs of early-1990s Landsat 4/5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, as part of the Upper Midwest Gap Analysis Program (UMGAP)( http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/reports_publications/psrs/psr_1999_04.html ) of the U.S. Geological Survey.  Units of analysis were Minnesota Ecological Classification System (ECS)( http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ecs/index.html ) subsections subdivided by TM scenes.  GAP typology and classification protocols are closely comparable across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
