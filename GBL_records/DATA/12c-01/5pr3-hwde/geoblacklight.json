The Special Service Area program is a mechanism used to fund expanded services and programs through a localized property tax levy within contiguous industrial, commercial and residential areas. The enhanced services and programs are in addition to services and programs currently provided through the city. SSA-funded projects could include, but are not limited to, security services, area marketing and advertising assistance, promotional activities such as parades and festivals, or any variety of small scale capital improvements that could be supported through a modest property tax levy.",
