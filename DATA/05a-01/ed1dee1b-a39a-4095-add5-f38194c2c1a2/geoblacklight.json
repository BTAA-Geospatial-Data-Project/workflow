  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows Minnesota's cisco refuge lakes. These lakes were identified by the University of Minnesota and Minnesota DNR Fisheries Research (Xing Fang, Liping Jiang, Peter C. Jacobson, Heinz G. Stefan, Shoeb R. Alam & Donald L. Pereira (2012): Identifying Cisco Refuge Lakes in Minnesota under Future Climate Scenarios, Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 141:6, 1608-1621). They are deep and clear enough that they will still provide suitable coldwater fish habitat even after significant climate warming. Cisco refuge lakes are classified as Tier 1 (the deepest and coldest with exceptional coldwater fish habitat - predicted TDO3<11 degrees C) and Tier 2 (less deep and cold, but still suitable coldwater habitat - predicted TDO3>11 and <17 degrees C).",
