The DNR may also list a lake, river, pond or wetland as infested if it is connected to a body of water where an aquatic invasive species is present.The list on the DNR website, not this GIS layer, is the official record of the infested waters list for MN. For more information, see the official infested waters list at: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/infested.html As of Jan. 2017, this layer is ~ 98% complete.
