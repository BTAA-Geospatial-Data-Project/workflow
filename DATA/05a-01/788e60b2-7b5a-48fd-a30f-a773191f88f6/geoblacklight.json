  "dc_description_s": "A polygon feature class used to map the spatial extent of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) projects and Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) areas in Minnesota. MPCA water resource staff identified Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) and Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) project boundaries as a central data element for the agency. A team of staff from the MPCA Watershed Division and the MPCA Information Systems Office worked together to collect and store this data in a central repository and distribute it to MPCA partners as needed. The team designed a geospatial database, developed a user guide, and developed communication and distribution strategies for the database.The resulting geospatial database is maintained by the MPCA Watershed Division and polygons are included in the database for all EPA-approved TMDL/WRAPS projects.",
