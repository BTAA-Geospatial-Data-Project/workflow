  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows Minnesota trout streams that have a special regulation as described in the <b>2016 Minnesota Fishing Regulations</b>.   Road crossings were determined using the 1991 Air Photos (1 - metre DOQs).  Check the fishing regulations booklet ( http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/regulations/fishing/index.html ) for detailed information. Note legal descriptions and restrictions associated with designated trout waters under the section <i>Special Regulations: Streams and Rivers</i> (p. 56-62).  Regulated segments are maintained as tabular data and displayed as linear events on the <a href=\"../../water_measured_kittle_routes/metadata/metadata.html\" target=_blank><b>Stream Routes with Kittle Numbers and Mile Measures</b></a> layer.  In the attribute table, designated segments extend from the FROM_MEAS (mile) to the TO_MEAS (mile) and have a total length = [LENGTH_MI] on a route with total length = [ROUTE_MI].",
