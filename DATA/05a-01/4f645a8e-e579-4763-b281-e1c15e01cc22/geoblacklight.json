Beginning in 2013 (Phase 2), lakes are classified into two tiers representing two levels of monitoring intensity: Tier 1 (intensive) and Tier 2 (reduced). Lake polygons are linked to Fact Sheets (all lakes) and Status Reports (some lakes). In ArcMap, select a lake using the Identify tool to display hotlinks to these PDFs.",
