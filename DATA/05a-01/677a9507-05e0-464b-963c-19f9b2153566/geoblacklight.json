  "dc_description_s": "This dataset depicts the planned alignments of future transitways which are in advanced design or under construction. Currently, this file includes alignments for Southwest LRT (Green Line Extension), Cedar Avenue BRT Phase 2 (Red Line), I-35W BRT (Orange Line), Bottineau LRT (Blue Line extension) and other planned Arterial BRT alignemnts.This file is markedly different from the 2040 Increased Revenue Transitway System file which depicts all potential transitways in the Twin Cities Metro Area. This file can be used at a large scale; however, these alignments are not a guarantee of actual completed alignment. File is for planning purposes only. Alignment is subject to change without warning. When transitway construction is completed and service begins, the alignment will move from this file to TransitwayAlignment (existing). Additional Notes:- Most alignments are managed by Rachel Wiken (see Section 7). Arterial BRT alignments are managed by:Katie Roth, Project ManagerMetro Transit BRT/Small Starts Project Office560 6th Ave NMinneapolis, MN 55411",
