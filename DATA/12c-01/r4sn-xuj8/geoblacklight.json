  "dc_description_s": "Preference boundaries for selected charter schools in the Chicago Public Schools district for school year 2016-2017. As opposed to elementary or high school attendance boundaries wherein each residing student is entitled to attend, charter boundaries simply serve as a guide for charter school administrators to use during the application/lottery process. Applicants residing within a specific boundary are generally given preference over applicants residing outside of the boundary. To view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as Google Earth or ArcGIS, are required.",
