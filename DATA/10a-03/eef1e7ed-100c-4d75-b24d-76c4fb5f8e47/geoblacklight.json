  "dc_description_s": "This layer includes a polygon coverage derived from 1:500,000-scale sources containing the output from the Groundwater Contamination Susceptibility Model (GCSM) for Wisconsin, and estimating the susceptibility of the state's groundwater to contamination from surface activities. The GCSM was developed by the DNR, the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey (WGNHS), and the University of Wisconsin  Madison in the mid-1980s. The results of the GCSM are illustrated in a map published in 1987 at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (available from the Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey: http://wgnhs.uwex.edu/maps-data/maps/",
