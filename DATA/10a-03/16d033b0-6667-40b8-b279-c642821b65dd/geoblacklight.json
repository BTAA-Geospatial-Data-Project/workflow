  "dc_description_s": "During the 2006 and 2007 field seasons the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry coordinated a survey of invasive plant species on priority sites in Wisconsin's northern State Forests (Black River SF, Brule River SF, Coulee Experimental SF, Flambeau River SF, Governor Knowles SF, Northern Highland-American Legion SF, and Peshtigo River SF) for the purpose of collecting information on the ecology of invasive plants, mapping the current existence and extent of invasive plant infestations within the state forests, establishing a baseline GIS database to aid in the development of invasive plant management goals and objectives, increasing departmental and public awareness of invasive plant issues, and creating support for management and prevention programs. Each State Forest identified a list of priority search areas for invasive plant surveys using maps and forest staff input. Priority areas include corridors along roads and trails, homesteads, boat landings, river ways, timber sales, gravel pits, recreational sites and campgrounds.",
