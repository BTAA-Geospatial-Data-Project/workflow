For example, the'District Department of Transportation's (DDOT)'traffic control officers write parking'violations'to prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections.Parking violation locations are summarized ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation.Data was originally downloaded from the'District Department of Motor Vehicle's'eTIMS meter work order management system.

Data was then visualized using the street segment centroid'coordinates.",
