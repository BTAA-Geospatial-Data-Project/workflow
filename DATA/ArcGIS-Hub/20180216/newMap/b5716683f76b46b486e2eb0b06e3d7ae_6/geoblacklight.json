  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap. maryland. gov. The Rivers_Streams feature class is the geospatial representation for linear bodies of water (e. g. rivers, streams, artificial paths for tidal waters, shorelines, etc) within Maryland's borders. This feature class is linked by relationship class to data from the 2012 Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality. This link allows for users to query water quality assessment information spatially and facilitates the development of other customized visuals. This feature class is built upon the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) which was generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.",
