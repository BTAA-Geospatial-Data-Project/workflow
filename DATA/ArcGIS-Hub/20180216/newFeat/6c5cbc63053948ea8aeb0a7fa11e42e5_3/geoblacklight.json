  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap. maryland. gov. These datasets exist in raster and vector formats. The vector format was created from the SHA Shoreline file and graphic representations in the Lippson book (See bibliography below). These areas were then overlane with a point file created from lat/long collected during the surveys conducted by O'dell, Mowrer, and Uphoff of MD DNR Fisheries Service. This was done to verify that the graphic representations were accurate. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.
