  "dc_description_s": "Highlights the LTS 3 road segments in the suburban counties that would enable the greatest number of new connections (top 10 % from each county) between Census blocks if improvements were made to reduce the stress level to LTS 1 or 2. In some cases, only one direction of a certain road segment made it into the top 10%. Road segments are shown as divided to allow users to see which side of the road made it into the top 10% and is considered a regional priority.Attributes show existing roadway conditions. If the segment has the potential to connect low-stress islands, the number of islands and specific island numbers are identified.?",
