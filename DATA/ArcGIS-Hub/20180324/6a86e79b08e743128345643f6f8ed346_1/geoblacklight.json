  "dc_description_s": "This data set contains surface and subsurface information used in the construction of the bedrock-topography maps for the state of Ohio. This data set was created as part of a project to create the new state bedrock-geology map for Ohio. The data in the dataset come from a number of different sources, which include water wells, ODOT bridge borings, Ohio EPA waste-disposal site borings, oil and gas wells, and information from published and unpublished reports, some of which are on file at the ODGS. Location information is plotted on 7.5-minute quadrangles.",
