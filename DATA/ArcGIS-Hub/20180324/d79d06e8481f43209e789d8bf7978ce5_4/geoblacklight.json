  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap. maryland. gov. The Tidal_Waters feature class is the geospatial representation for tidal bodies of water (e. g. Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay, Coastal Bays, and Atlantic Ocean) within Maryland's borders. This feature class is linked by relationship class to data from the 2014 Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality. This link allows for users to query water quality assessment information spatially and facilitates the development of other customized visuals. This feature class is built upon the Chesapeake Bay Program's salinity segmentation scheme and Maryland's coverage for the Coastal Bays. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.",
