  "dc_title_s": "Pedestrian Count at Intersections: Hennepin County, Minnesota",
  "dc_description_s": "Since 2016, Hennepin County has organized counts at locations outside of Minneapolis, counting both pedestrians and bicyclists. These short term counts rely on volunteers collecting data over a two-hour window, from 4:00-6:00 PM during the second week of September each year. The raw data from the counts was then used to calculate estimated daily traffic (EDT) at each site, which means that 2-hour counts are extrapolated to understand larger trends in walking and biking. Hennepin County's volunteer counts take place in conjunction with the City of Minneapolis pedestrian and bicycle counts. Hennepin County leads the initiative for all counts outside of the City of Minneapolis; however, the county still utilizes data for county roads within the City of Minneapolis. This data shows the EDT for pedestrians and bicyclists at each intersection, in all directions.
