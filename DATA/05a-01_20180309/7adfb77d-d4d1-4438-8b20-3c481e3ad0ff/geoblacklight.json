  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows legally designated trout lakes as identified in Minnesota Rules Chapter 6264.0050. These are inland lakes managed by DNR Fisheries for trout species (not including lake trout). In order to protect and foster the propagation of trout species, several restrictions on fishing in these lakes apply. See MN Rules 6264.0050 http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/arule/6264/0050.html for legal descriptions and restrictions associated with designated trout waters. For more information about lakes managed for trout species, see the following: Trout Lakes: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/trout_lakes/index.htmlTrout Lakes List (list of trout species x lake): http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/trout_lakes/list.htmlNote: In addition to Designated Trout Lakes, Stream Trout Lakes are specifically managed for stream trout species (i.e., rainbow trout, brook trout, brown trout and splake), although they are an official designation in MN Rules. See Stream Trout Lakes.",
