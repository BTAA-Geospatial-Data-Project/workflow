  "dc_description_s": "This is a set of the impaired streams as determined by MPCA in 2009 for the 2010 reporting cycling to US EPA.The streams are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). MPCA adds additional stream reaches. Since the impaired streams are a small subset of the NHD streams, only that subset is included in the dataset. This dataset includes impaired streams which have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA, those that have a US EPA approved TMDL plan as well as those streams that do not need a TMDL plan.",
