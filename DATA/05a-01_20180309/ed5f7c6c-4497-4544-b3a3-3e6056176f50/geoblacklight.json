  "dc_description_s": "This dataset was created by the MRCC, a joint collaborative project involving the technical and managerial GIS staff from the Seven Metropolitan Counties (Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington), the Metropolitan Emergency Services Board, the Metropolitan Council and MnGeo with the primary goal to develop a road centerline data model and dataset that meets core business needs of local governments and regional interests. Core needs this dataset are intended to satisfy include:- Vehicular routing;- Address geocoding;- Next Generation 911 call routing and location validation;- Emergency services dispatching;- Linear referencing uses;- Cartographic representation of road features;The MRCC encourages other counties and stakeholders across Minnesota to build upon the work of the MRCC and not have to replicate the process of model development. The MRCC does not claim to have the full knowledge of the unique road data needs to be anticipated from stakeholders in Greater Minnesota such as national and state forest roadway, tribal nation roadways and so on. The MRCC endeavors to have this effort augment and support larger statewide road dataset development efforts in the future.For specific questions regarding centerline alignments or attributes, please contact the county belowAnoka: https://www.anokacounty.us/315/GISCarver: gis@co.carver.mn.usDakota: gis@co.dakota.mn.usHennepin: gis.info@hennepin.usRamsey: RCGISMetaData@co.ramsey.mn.usScott: gis@co.scott.mn.usWashington: surveyor@co.washington.mn.us",
