  "dc_description_s": "The Transit Patterns layer contains all fixed patterns serving the Twin Cities regional metropolitan area. A single route has multiple patterns often characterized by different terminals or branches. One shape and one corresponding record exists for each individual transit pattern. The line work for the dataset was derived from NCompass Technologies Centerline and Address Ranges dataset. A small number of line segments have been added to completely depict all patterns traveled by fixed-route transit vehicles.",
