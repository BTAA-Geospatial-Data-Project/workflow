  "dc_description_s": "GAMMA_RAY_LOGS_IGS_IN.shp shows the locations of the Indiana Geological Survey's natural gamma-ray logs that were collected from 1978 to 2012. It was updated by Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) personnel on May 9, 2012 to add new data and to include existing locations of wells with \"sample only\" designations (rotary cuttings or cores) that were formerly excluded. Additionally, the dataset now contains an attribute field named \"SAMPLE_ID\" for referencing physical samples in the IGS Archives. Data were updated in the attribute field named \"Type\" to differentiate between wells which have only gamma-ray logs (value of \"GL\"), wells with gamma-ray logs and physical samples (value of \"LS\"), or wells where only samples (value of \"SO\") were collected. This shapefile also includes information concerning coordinate locations, surface elevation, and vertical depths of gamma-logs.",
