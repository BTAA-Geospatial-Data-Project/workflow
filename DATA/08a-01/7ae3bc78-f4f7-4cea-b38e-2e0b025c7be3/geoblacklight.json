  "dc_description_s": "This dataset is a representation of forest patches derived from the tree canopy class in the 2010-2011 high-resolution land cover dataset for the northern section of the Delaware River Basin. Three classes of forest patches were derived: 1) small, 2) medium, and 3) large. A customized algorithm using object-based image analysis techniques within the eCognition software package was to divide the tree canopy into the forest patch classes based on a combination of a combination of size, edge to perimeter ratio, length, and width. In general, small patches represent individual trees or small rows of trees. Medium patches represent clumps of trees, often in suburban or agricultural settings, that are fragmented and may or may not have a duff layer. Large forest patches consist of forested stands that in most cases will have a duff layer.End users of this layer should note that this forest patch classification is one approach and the dataset should be evaluated so as to understand its capabilities and limitations before using for decision making purposes.",
