This file was delineated in 2006 from two sources: (1) Susquehanna River Basin Commission hand drawn basin boundary appearing on hardcopy 1:24,000 USGS topographic maps and (2) the Smallsheds dataset from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). The Pennsylvania portion of the drainage basin was taken largely from the smallsheds dataset. The New York and Maryland portions were modified from the previous version of the SRB shapefile to match the SRBC hand drawn basin boundary from the USGS topo maps.",
