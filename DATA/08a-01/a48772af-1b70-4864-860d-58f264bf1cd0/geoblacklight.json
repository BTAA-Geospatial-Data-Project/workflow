  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using the attribute field 'HYDCLPRS' from the SSURGO Soils data for each county in the study area as originated by U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Areas with a value of 'All hydric' or 'Partially hydric' in the 'HYDCLPRS' attribute field were assigned a conservation value of 3. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",
