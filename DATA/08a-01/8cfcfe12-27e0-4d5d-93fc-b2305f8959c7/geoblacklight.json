  "dc_description_s": "The Bureau of Forestry uses a modified version of the Recreational Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) to estimate the wild character of state forest land and the experience that recreationists can be expected to find in different portions of state forest system. This dataset represents the excepted ROS experience as of December 31, 2012. The Bureau of Forestrys ROS zones are defined as: Primitive: greater than 1,000 acres and more than 1 mile from motorized roads, trails, and railroads. Semi-Primitive: greater than 500 acres and more than 1/2 mile from motorized roads, trails, and railroads.Semi-Primitive Non-motorized: greater than 250 acres and more than 1/4 mile from motorized roads, trails, and railroads.Semi-Developed and Developed (Other Zones): No minimum size or remoteness criteria. The ROS model considers all changes. Non-shale gas related changes do affect the results of the analysis.",
