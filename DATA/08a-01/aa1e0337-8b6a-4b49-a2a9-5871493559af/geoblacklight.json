  "dc_description_s": "Multi-spectral digital orthophotography was produced at a scale of 1:2400 (1 in = 200 ft) with a 12 inch pixel resolution for the YCPC project area. Digital orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Orthophoto data is produced through the use of digitized perspective aerial photographs or other remotely sensed image data. This data is processed into a digital product that has been rectified for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement caused by terrain relief, and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation.",
