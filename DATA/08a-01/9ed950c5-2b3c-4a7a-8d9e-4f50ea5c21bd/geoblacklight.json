  "dc_description_s": "Digital orthophoto covering Lehigh and Northampton County, Pennsylvania that was flown in spring 2010. An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Flown during leaf off conditions between March 27, 2010 and April 22, 2010. Digital imagery at 1''= 200' design scale natural color aerial photography at 1' pixel resolution. Image tile dimensions are 5000' by 5000' and 1000 tiles cover the entirety of Lehigh and Northampton Counties.",
