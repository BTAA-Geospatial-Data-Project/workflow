  "dc_description_s": "Coal mining has occurred in Pennsylvania for over a century. The maps to these coal mines are stored at many various public and private locations (if they still exist at all) throughout the commonwealth. This dataset tries to identify the Mined Out Areas of the various coal seams in Pennsylvania. This information can be used for many environmental related issues, including mine land reclamation and determination of needs for Mine Subsidence Insurance. The information in this dataset was gathered from mine maps at these various locations so that the data can be readily available to environmental professionals.",
