  "dc_description_s": "View More Information about Maryland's Transit Oriented Development on their story map: http://bit.ly/MDOT_TOD. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is an approach to land use planning and development which promotes the efficient use of land and transportation infrastructure. TODs are generally higher density developments comprising a mix of residential, office, commercial, and civic uses in a pedestrian friendly environment within walking distance of a transit center. In 2008 the Maryland legislature adopted a formal definition for TOD as a dense, mixed-use, deliberately planned development within a half-mile of transit stations that is designed to increase transit ridership. Official designation of a TOD was enabled under statute in 2008. The intent of designation is to facilitate MDOT's more direct involvement in the above activities, by clarifying that in specific project areas (which must be within a half mile of a transit station), TOD is to be considered as a transportation purpose. By statute, TODs are to be automatically included in the interagency Sustainable Community designation, which implies eligibility/prioritization for several state discretionary programs and expanded scope for local use of Tax Increment Finance (TIF) for related projects.The local jurisdiction with land use authority may nominate a project as part of their annual priority letter for MDOT (generally due in April/May). Staff works with local jurisdiction to define the nomination and collect background materials. Final materials are vetted with the Secretary of Transportation and the Smart Growth Sub-cabinet for recommendation. The Secretary of Transportation conveys the outcomes of the review process, and offers official designation to local jurisdictions as appropriate. Local jurisdictions then take action to formalize the agreement (including boundaries) by official resolution. When this step is complete, the project is considered to be officially designated. The designation does not imply that any specific funding or assistance will be automatically allocated. Needs and expectations of support from both state and local agencies should be clarified as part of the designation process.",
