  "dc_description_s": "This data represents addresses for Wood County, Wisconsin in 2020. [Site Address points exist for all known addressed structures located within the county. Coordinating the collection of new and changed addresses across the County is a challenge. Wood County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) manages addresses for most towns, and some villages. The County works with municipalities that it does not issue addresses for, to update the site address database that is used for a variety of applications including emergency dispatch. Municipalities managing their own addresses include the Town of Grand Rapids, villages of Biron, Rudolph, Milladore, and Port Edwards along with the cities of Wisconsin Rapids, Marshfield and Pittsville. Address points are mapped to the driveway and then adjusted to the structure after each round of aerial photography.]",
