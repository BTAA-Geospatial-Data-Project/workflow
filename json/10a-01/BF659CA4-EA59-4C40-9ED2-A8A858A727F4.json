Basins and watersheds are interconnected areas of land draining from surrounding ridge tops to a common point such as a lake or confluence with a neighboring land area.These watersheds were originally delineated by Wisconsin DNR for the Nonpoint Source Water Pollution Abatement Program, also generally known as the Priority Watershed Program. They generally indicate areas that drain into a common river system or lake, but may also be based on DNR basin management criteria.]",
