[The 2010 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER geographic database. These boundary files are specifically designed for small scale thematic mapping. When possible generalization is performed with intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based shapefiles while others are available only as state-based files.]",
