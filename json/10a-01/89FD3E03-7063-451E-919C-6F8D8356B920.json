Also provided are raster average minimum and maximum temperature datasets from derived average annual temperature according to a model using point temperature data for the 30-year period of 1981-2010. PRISM is an analytical model that uses point data and an underlying grid such as a digital elevation model (DEM) or a 30 yr climatological average (e.g. 1981- 2010 average) to generate gridded estimates of monthly and annual precipitation and temperature (as well as other climatic parameters). 800m spacing. ]",
