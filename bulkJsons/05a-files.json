The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.Users are encouraged to refer to the U.S. Census website for more information on ZCTAs: http:\/\/www.census.gov\/geo\/reference\/zctas.html and to the U.S. Postal Service for more information on ZIP Codes: http:\/\/faq.usps.com\/",

This website contains a searchable inventory of those properties, as well as sites that have already been cleaned up and those currently being investigated or cleaned up.Environmental permits and registrations: This Web application also contains a searchable inventory of businesses that have applied for and received different types of environmental permits and registrations from the MPCA.Methods for creating site locations have different levels of precision. The most accurate locations use coordinates from GPS (global positioning system). Coordinates are also derived using the site's street address, zip code or public land survey information. Some MPCA sites are not mapped. These are generally activities that are mobile, like ships with ballast water permits.",

"dc_description_s": "This data set depicts watershed district and watershed management organization boundaries throughout the state of Minnesota. Watershed districts are local units of government that work to solve and prevent water-related problems. The boundaries of the districts closely follow those of a natural watershed (an area in which all water drains to one point). Minnesota has 46 watershed districts, most of which are named after the primary lake or river within the watershed. Minnesota's watershed districts do not cover the entire state. They are created through a local petition process. Minnesota Statute Chapter 103D governs the formation and operation of watershed districts. In 1982, the Minnesota Legislature approved the Metropolitan Area Surface Water Management Act (Minnesota Statutes 103B.201 to 255), which requires local units of government in the seven-county Metro Area to prepare and implement comprehensive surface water management plans through membership in a watershed management organization (WMO).A watershed management organization (WMO) is defined as a watershed district wholly within the seven-county, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area or a joint powers entity established wholly or partly in the metropolitan area by special law or agreement to perform some or all of the functions of a watershed district. NOTES: - MANY BOUNDARY DISCREPANCIES EXIST WITH THIS DATA SET. See Lineage in Section 2 of this metadata for more details. This layer represents BWSR's most current information on watershed districts and WMOs in the State of MN. The dataset is NOT error free, and boundaries are frequently being updated and changed, so these should be used for reference only. Water planning is either the responsibility of a watershed district or a water management org. If neither of these exist, then responsibility falls onto the county. For a more precise boundary determination, check with the BWSR board conservationist for the area in question.",

(1989), Ground water contamination susceptibility in Minnesota, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, St. Paul, Minn., 29 p.].In 1989, Porcher prepared a statewide assessment of groundwater contamination susceptibility, using the statewide Quaternary geology map that was prepared by the Minnesota Geological Survey (Hobbs, 1982). In 2011, an interagency group (MDH, MDA, and DNR) worked to find a map that would be an update to the map used by Porcher in 1989. The interagency work group decided that the statewide geomorphology layer that was produced by the Minnesota Geological Survey and the University of Minnesota at Duluth (DNR, UMD, MGS 1997) provided an updated interpretation of Quaternary materials and at higher level of resolution than the 1982 map with the addition of a Quaternary sand and gravel layer file to capture the \"Beach Sands\" in the northeast. The geomorphology layer includes generalized categories of the sediments or bedrock types that are associated with landforms and can be used to assign geologic sensitivity ratings. The ratings are based upon guidance from the Geologic Sensitivity Project Workgroup (DNR, 1991).MDA developed this dataset based on the guidance from the 2011 interagency workgroup.",

"dc_description_s": "These data represent surface water features, derived from the Minnesota DNR's Public Waters Inventory and the US Fish and Wildlife Services' National Wetlands Inventory.1. PWI basins were intersected with NWI wetlands - the area of each unique wetland type within each basin was calculated. Each basin was then assigned that wetland type which covered the greatest proportion of its extent.2. Approximate depths were assigned to all wetland types present in the study area. The data were saved in tabular form, and joined to the basins feature class by wetland type - thus an approximate depth was derived for each basin.3. The basin extents were clipped from the wetlands feature class - wetland fragments less than 60 square meters were then removed, as the basin and wetland edges weren't perfectly coincident, and polygon slivers remained after the clip.4. The depth table was joined to the wetlands by wetland type, and each wetland was assigned an approximate depth. Adjacent wetlands of the same depth were then dissolved together.5. Basins and wetlands were merged into a single feature class. An ID was assigned to each wetland, based on the county in which the greatest proportion of the wetland is found.",

"dc_description_s": "A concern for visual quality Minnesota forests are particularly vital to the health of two industries: tourism and forest products. While many of the demands on the forests from these two industries are compatible and even complementary, concern about the specific impacts of various forest management practices on visual quality became the focus for a positive dialogue tourism and forest products industries. In the fall of 1990, representatives of the Minnesota Resort Association and the Minnesota Forest Industries began meeting to address the issue of visual quality. A Timber and Tourism Steering Committee was formed to enhance communication, promote understanding and continue to discuss common concerns. Under the leadership of the Steering Committee, public and private forestry interest came together and developed a set of visual quality guidelines. Visual Sensitivity Classification The visual quality guidelines recognized the fact that not all travel routes have the same level of visual sensitivity. To implementation of the visual quality guidelines, classification of the visual sensitivity of highways, roads, designated recreation trails, lakes, and rivers in forested areas was required. County Visual Quality Committees were formed to classify travel routes within their counties. The county committees were made up of county residents that represented tourism and forest products industries and interests. Three factors were used in the classification process:- The perceived degree of sensitivity of users of a travel route or recreation area concerning landscape aesthetics.- The volume and type of use a travel route or recreation area receives.- The speed of travel within a route or area. The levels of visual sensitivity are:Most sensitive - Applies to travel routes and areas where significant public use occurs and where the visual quality is of high concern to typical users. Examples of such routes may include public highways, local roads, recreational lakes and rivers, and designated recreational trails and areas that provide a high level of scenic quality. Moderately sensitive - Applies to travel routes or recreation areas, not included in Level 1, where visual quality is of moderate concern to typical users. Examples of these routes and areas may include public highways and local roads, recreational lakes and rivers, and designated recreational trails that provide moderate to high scenic quality but less significant public use. Less sensitive - Applies to travel routes or recreation areas, not included in Levels 1 or 2, where visual quality is of less concern to typical users. Examples of these routes may include public highways and low-volume local forest roads, nondesignated trails, and nonrecreational lakes and rivers.",

The concept was initially developed in 1996 Transit Redesign to provide general guidelines on the mix of transit services that may be appropriate for a given area. This guidance is provided for broad regional context; appropriate transit services are defined through professional transit service planning processes. The existing market area definitions identify five market areas, with Area I supporting the most intensive transit service and area 5 supporting the least intensive transit service. Transit Market Areas were first introduced in the 1996 Transit Redesign report produced by the Metropolitan Council. They have been updated periodically since then to better reflect census geography and demographic shifts and to refine the appropriate measures of transit supportiveness.The current Transit Market Areas, developed for the 2040 TPP update, are based on an index of population density, employment density, automobile availability (population over 16 less available automobiles), and intersection density (an indicator of urban form measured as a weighted count of intersections by block group).",

Field attributes include sources where these facilities were identified as Transit Centers. Some locations have additional facilities such as shelters, park and rides and rail stations. In many cases these are places where: 1. Two or more routes connect to transfer passengers 2. Buses connect off street, or in clearly designated on-street spaces 3. There are multiple marked 'gates' for different routes and directions 4. The location serves a major activity center, such as a shopping center. 5.

Beginning in the late 1840s, the federal government began surveying Minnesota as part of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The resulting network of land survey lines divided the state into townships, ranges, sections, quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections and government lots, and laid the groundwork for contemporary land ownership patterns. The township, range and section boundaries were digitized at MnGeo (formerly known as the Land Management Information Center - LMIC) from stable base mylars of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 30-minute latitude by 60-minute longitude map series (1:100,000-scale). All survey lines were extended across water bodies despite the fact that U.S. Geological Survey base maps depict them only on land. This addition allows all sections and townships to be represented as closed areas (polygons) ensuring that township and range location can be determined for any point in the state. It also means that the data set is not affected if lake levels change over time.",

At the time of the Bell System breakup, Bell operating companies were restricted to operations within specific areas called LATAs. Wire centers or 'wire center serving area', refers to the area to which local service is provided by one or more switches located at a single point. The wire center serving area is often the same area as the exchange, but a wire center can be equal to a portion of an exchange or to several exchanges combined.The data was compiled in cooperation with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and the Minnesota incumbent local exchange carriers. The dataset was republished in June 2016 to correct the \"FROZEN\" attribute for the Blackduck Exchange.",

The events were then categorized as one of four types: Altered, Natural, Impounded, or No definable channel, based upon a standardized methodology and criteria.

Line features may represent any facility or feature that may need to show the length and direction of the feature. Several examples of features that may be represented as lines include roads and trails, fence, dike, ditch or stream, drainage tile, fire breaks, water control structures, gates, culverts, bridges, docks, and utility or rail road lines.The point layer contains facilities and features for WMAs that are best represented as points. Several examples of features that may be represented as points include parking lots, water access, signs, gates, bridges, camping facilities, blinds, water control structures, feeding structures, nesting and breeding structures, buildings, reference points and cultural features. Disclaimer: The only features in this theme are WMA user facilities such as parking lots, water accesses, trails and blinds. WMA management facilities such as water control structures, restricted roads, gates and habitat structures have been removed from this layer.The facility layer should be accurate enough to provide information for management and planning activities as well as for general reference on maps. The classification system used in this inventory is intended to accurately describe the facility or feature at the time of the inventory as well as its future condition given that money is available to maintain that facility or feature. There may be plans to develop the facility to improve public access or improve habitat for desired wildlife species. WMAs have restrictions on types of public use, therefore creating maps of WMAs as general recreation or hunting areas has some peril. Some portions of WMAs are wildlife sanctuaries, some WMAs are only open to public use during certain times of the year, some require landowner permission for access and some WMAs are legally closed to the public.",

When there is no match to the PLS forty or government lot in the PLS40 layer, a record is then matched to the PLS section layer. These layers merge the DNR Control Point Generated PLS layer (PLS40) with land records stored in the DNR's Land Record System (LRS) in Oracle. The data are limited to a forty, government lot, or section level representation. Therefore, any state owned lands that are less than a forty, government lot, or section, are represented by the entire forty, government lot, or section. There are many different ways to look at these State lands. In this case, layers have been created and grouped by selecting the type of State land, the type of interest held by the State, or the administrator of the State land, as follows:- one set of layers (i.e., stateland_type_xxx, where xxx represents the various categories) is created by selecting for the various land types stored in the LANDTYPE field. This set of layers only considers Fee Surface interests.- a second set of layers (i.e., stateland_interest_xxx, where xxx represents the various types of surface interests) is created by selecting for the various interest types stored in the INT_TYPE field. Note: the stateland_interest_conservationeasement layer is a subset of the stateland_interest_easementin layer, so conservation easement records are also in the stateland_interest_easementin layer.- a third set of layers (i.e., stateland_admin_xxx, where xxx represents the various MNDNR units or a county administers these surface interests) is created by selecting for the various administrators stored in the ADMINISTRATOR or ADMPRGPRJADDL fields. One view of this set of layers includes all surface interest types, while the other view only includes fee surface interests.",

Private or other ownerships included inside a State Forest boundary are typically NOT identified in legislative language and subsequently are NOT mapped in this layer. It is important to note that these data do not represent public ownership. State Forest boundaries often include private land and should not be used to determine ownership. Ownership information can be found in the State Lands by Administrator - Forestry layer ( http:\/\/gisdata.mn.gov\/dataset\/plan-state-lands-dnr-interest ) and the GAP Stewardship 2008 layer ( http:\/\/gisdata.mn.gov\/dataset\/plan-gap-stewardship-2008 ).Data has been updated during 2009 by the MNDNR Forest Resource Assessment office.State Forests - Management UnitsThis theme shows the land owned and managed by the Division of Forestry within the Statutory Boundaries. The shapes were derived mostly from county parcel data, where available, and from plat maps and other ownership resources. This data presents an approximate location of the land ownership and is intended for cartographic purposes only. It is not survey quality and should never be used to resolve land ownership disputes.State Forests - Other Forest LandsThis theme shows State Forest lands outside of the State Forest Statutory Boundaries.

This shapefile provides a polygon boundary for the St. Louis River Area of Concern and the Expanded Study Area surrounding Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin. In developing the polygon boundary, the description of each AOC provided by EPA was used as a starting point for collecting basemap information to aid in the delineation of each boundary. Using Digital Orthophotography, Digital Raster Graphics, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) layers such as watersheds, and water bodies where available, each polygon was then digitized and reviewed by representatives of both EPA, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for agreement. Sources of digital information used in the development of the AOCs include the USGS, the Microsoft Corporation Terraserver ( http:\/\/terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com\/default.aspx ), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources GIS Data Deli ( http:\/\/deli.dnr.state.mn.us\/ ), and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ( http:\/\/www.dnr.state.wi.us\/ ).",

Seed source control prevents losses by avoiding the use of non-adapted materials in artificial regeneration. Seed source control establishes collection and deployment zones based on climate homogeneity. Based on climatic data, six seed zones were determined appropriate and adequate for Minnesota. An area of special concern is the north shore area of Lake Superior. This area lies roughly from Two Harbors to the Canadian border and, from the shoreline to the ridge that defines the north shore. Several studies have shown this region to consistently produce trees with slower growth. Unless there is some compelling local need, seed should not be collected from this area.",

These feature classes support MNNR's SNA Work Planning application.scientific_and_natural_area_boundaries: A polygon feature class delineated on and digitized from 1:24,000 U.S.G.S. quad maps of Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas (SNAs).Scientific and natural areas are established to protect and perpetuate in an undisturbed natural state those lands and waters embracing natural features of exceptional scientific and educational value. The SNA Program's goal is to ensure that no single rare feature is lost from any region of the state. This requires protection and management of each feature in sufficient quantity and distribution across the landscape. The Programs' Long Range Plan is to protect at least five locations of plant communities known to occur in each landscape region, and three locations per region of each rare species, plant or animal, and geologic feature. It is estimated that 500 natural areas are needed throughout the state to adequately protect significant features. Because over 40 percent of these rare features occur in prairies, 200 SNAs would be in the prairie area of the state. Of the remainder, approximately 135 are estimated to be needed in the deciduous and 165 in coniferous forest landscape communities in the next 100 years. Protection of multiple sites in each landscape region is a vital means of capturing the genetic diversity and preventing the loss of important species, communities, and features. This strategy observes the wisdom of not putting all our eggs in one basket. In addition to SNA, Itasca and Crow Wing Counties have established county natural areas. Itasca County's natural areas were established in 1966. Sites are set aside as SNAs because of their natural attributes and rare resources, which warrant protection for their inherent values and as places for scientific and educational use. Protection guards against developments such as trails, campgrounds, picnic sites, logging, mineral exploration and development, cultivation, and other uses of land, public or private, that interfere with the preservation of its natural features",

"dc_description_s": "The point locations of school programs are a result of an ongoing project to identify current school program locations where Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) programs are utilized. The FNS Office is in the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE). GIS at MDE modified the data set using school building locations provided by the school districts and program locations from an MDE database. School District buildings are annually updated but there may remain errors due to the number of program locations and the frequency with which they move from building to building in a District. The records in this file cover all school program locations that MDE currently has in a spatial format. Note that multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points. For example, a junior and a senior high school may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and point in the data layer. This file is a geodatabase that contains one school program location file for school year 2009-2010. Before SY2009-10, school program locations were stored in separate files for different school programs (public, nonpublic, and charter, and public school district center). Beginning in 2009 program locations were combined into one file and attributes are used to distinguish the school types. Files for years before 2009 can be found online organized by location type.",

'900' Routes are for route segments that formerly were part of a trunk highway which was turned back to a local entity.

This was generated using cost \/ distance analysis, finding the shortest connection through the best land cover types between the patches.

Connections through developed areas were made if that was the only choice. Only patches within 5 kilometers of each other were connected.",

"dc_description_s": "The Metropolitan Council routinely compiles individual land use plans and plan amendments from communities within the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area into a single regional data layer. A principal goal of the Regional Planned Land Use dataset is to allow users to view, analyze and display planned land use data for anywhere in the seven county metropolitan area with a consistent land use classification scheme. The Metropolitan Council uses the Regional Planned Land Use (PLU) data to help monitor growth and plan for regional services such as regional parks, transit service, and wastewater collection and treatment. Although the planned land use data is based on the locally adopted land use plans and designations for each community, it represent only data that has been submitted to the Metropolitan Council for review per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 under Completeness information. Since there is no official State or Regional land use coding scheme that communities must conform with, the variability of content and codes between communities' land use plans is nearly as vast as the number of communities themselves (187). Differences among communities can range from the implementation of different land use categories to conflicting definitions of similar categories. The PLU dataset attempts to effectively level out the variability among communities by translating communities land use categories and descriptions into a common classification scheme developed and endorsed by MetroGIS (a regional GIS data sharing consortium) participants while retaining each communities' original categories. Although the comparability of land use plans between communities has greatly improved as a result of this translation or \"regionalization\" of communities' land use codes, it is possible that not all community land use definitions have been precisely translated into the most appropriate regional land use category. In conjunction with other regional information (i.e., land use trend data, households and jobs forecasts), the PLU data can help communities more easily understand regional and sub-regional planning goals and Council staff, working with individual local units of government, can better plan for the future needs and financing of regional services. - Contact individual communities for more information on their locally adopted planned land use categories. - See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the development of the regional dataset and its accuracy. - See Entities and Attributes Information (Section 5 of this metadata) for specifics about the regional land use codes and categories.",

"dc_description_s": "This file is a geodatabase that contains public school program locations in the state of Minnesota for school years 2002\/03 - 2008\/09. Before SY2009-10, school program locations were stored in separate files for different school programs (public, nonpublic, and charter, and public school district center). Beginning in 2009 program locations were combined into one file and attributes are used to distinguish the school types. Files for years after 2009 are posted seperately (see Associated Data Sets). Each file in this group was developed from annual information and is now provided as historical information. This metadata summarizes the content of these files but individual metadata records are also included for each annual fileThe point locations of school programs are a result of an ongoing project to identify current school program locations where Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) programs are utilized. The FNS Office is in the Department of Education. GIS at MDE modified the data set using school building locations provided by the school districts and program locations from an MDE database. The records cover traditional K-12 programs. New for SY2006-07 were Charter and other public schools or buildings that are a part of the public school system. These were added to the public schools and are delineated using separate attributes (see lineage). Note that multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points. For example, a junior and a senior high school may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and point in the data layer.",

Through a process of deductive assessment that incorporates USDA\/NAIP aerial imagery (instead of the more common NASS satellite imagery) the project identifies and removes all tillage and physical land disturbance history to accurately identify the location of lands with the highest probability of being truly native (virgin) sod. This deductive approach is unlike any grassland modeling project ever conducted. Conservation organizations across the region are excited about the results and using the data as a key foundational 'cornerstone' tool for refining and creating protocols for targeted grassland conservation programs, species-specific research, and long-term conservation planning. Project Location Description: Currently this assessment has been done for eastern South Dakota and the Prairie Coteau and Lac Qui Parle landscapes in western and southwestern Minnesota, with the intent of creating a template for all of the Great Plains. The work in Minnesota was commissioned by the Local Technical Teams implementing the Minnesota Prairie Conservation Plan. Funding was provided by the DNR Section of Wildlife's Working Lands Initiative. Data from the assessment of Eastern South Dakota can be found here: http:\/\/openprairie.sdstate.edu\/data_land-easternSD\/1\/",

One Watershed, One Plan is rooted in this history and in work initiated in 2011 by the Local Government Water Roundtable (Association of Minnesota Counties, Minnesota Association of Watershed Districts, and Minnesota Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts). Roundtable members determined that it is in the public interest to manage groundwater and surface water resources from the perspective of watersheds to achieve protection, preservation, enhancement, and restoration of the state's valuable water resources. Supporting this determination, the Roundtable recommended that the local governments charged with water management should organize and develop focused implementation plans on a watershed scale. The recommendation was followed by the One Watershed, One Plan legislation (Minnesota Statutes \ufffd\ufffd103B.101 Subd. 14,)that permits the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) to adopt methods to allow comprehensive plans, local water management plans, or watershed management plans to serve as substitutes for one another; or to be replaced with one comprehensive watershed management plan. The legislation also required BWSR to establish a suggested watershed boundary framework for these plans. This Framework consists of three parts: the suggested boundary map; procedures for establishing boundaries, requesting variances on boundaries, and appealing boundaries; and the criteria used to establish and consider requested variances from the suggested boundary map.",

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products:1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover;2) NLCD 2006\/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class;3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness;4) NLCD 2006\/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels; and5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the U.S.D.A. Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center.In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path\/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006\/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the attribute table. Also, as part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001. See Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail:Tree Canopy READMETree Canopy Analytical VersionTree Canopy Cartographic VersionTree Canopy Cover Supplmental MetadataAll other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path\/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 products can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS\/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",

Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state\/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992\/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.

Sites in this program are managed by various public agencies with management recommendations provided by the Scientific and Natural Areas program and Regional Ecologist. NARs are established through the use of Natural Area Registry (NAR) Agreements which are non-binding written agreements between the Division of Ecological and Water Resources (EWR) and another governmental entity. The NAR Agreement identifies the site, explains its significance, describes a proposed management direction, and states that before any management contrary to that direction may occur, the parties who signed the agreement will discuss that proposed management activity. Note: formerly a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" (MOU) was the vehicle used as the NAR agreement and in many documents, preceding development of this Directive, these terms were used interchangeably.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Natural Areas Registry is intended to recognize tracts of public land that contain natural features of statewide ecological significance and possess exceptional scientific or educational value. NARs recognize the agencies and individuals that manage these lands to protect and perpetuate the features of interest. Minnesota Statute 86A.05, Subd. 5 states that the Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas Program was \"established to protect and perpetuate in an undisturbed natural state those natural features which possess exceptional scientific or educational value.\" This Registry acknowledges that many of Minnesota's finest natural areas occur on other public lands that are not designated as SNAs. Through adoption of ecologically-based management principles and voluntary coordination between the land manager and the SNA Program, Registry sites protect a broader cross section of the state's natural diversity. Tracts of public land that contain viable examples of natural features of statewide ecological significance may be identified as NAR candidate sites. Qualifying sites are selected based upon Landowner\/Primary Administrator interest and on the site's ecological quality. Priority is given to sites that are within MCBS-mapped outstanding and high biodiversity significance sites, are predominantly MCBS-mapped native plant communities, and contain habitat for rare species and Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), or geological features of statewide significance. Sites nominated for potential NAR registration are reviewed using information compiled in an Ecological Evaluation (EE) or brief written summary of natural features, to determine if the site qualifies for NAR and if protection through NAR is acceptable to all parties. The Natural Areas Registry was established in the early 1980s within the DNR Section of Wildlife's Natural Heritage Program, in order to recognize public lands which contain natural features of special interest and to facilitate their protection and perpetuation. The Registry was modeled after The Nature Conservancy's Private Lands Register, which is no longer in existence. A number of other states (and international governmental entities) have a Natural Area Registry or Natural Area Register, which may supplement or be in lieu of a system of designated Natural Areas. In 1986, the administration of the Registry, with 26 NAR sites, was transferred from the Natural Heritage Program to the SNA Program. Both programs were within the DNR Section of Wildlife at the time. The first NAR site established was the Soudan Iron Formation at Tower Soudan State Park, February 1982. From the inception of the Natural Area Registry in 1982 through April 2014, there are 41 sites in the Registry. Note: through 2011 the NAR has been referred to as both Natural Area Register and Natural Area Registry, with adoption of this directive, the name Natural Area Registry will consistency be used in all future NAR Agreements, and if\/when updated, previous agreements will be changed to use this naming convention.This Representation SNA boundaries is based on the NAR_BASE_DATA feature class in the DNR's core GIS Library. It includes only DEDICATED features, which are dissolved on the following attributes: SITENAME, SITE_ID, BREMCODE. The coverage should be reasonably accurate although the boundaries probably will not line up with other public land survey information. Some of the boundaries for NAR sites have been created by DNR and other partner staff, and are often sub units within a larger unit. Since the NAR boundaries have no legal standing, the accuracy of boundaries vary from site to site, but are typically reasonable approximations of the NAR site boundary.",

After interpreting the aerial photographs, delineations were transferred to a 1:24,000 scale orthogonal base, digitized, and coded in conformance to the USFWS classification scheme and structured into a DLG format. The original interpretation\/automation effort was performed under contract by GEONIX-MARTEL of St. Petersburg, FL.

"dc_description_s": "The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) data for Minnesota are being updated through a multi-agency collaborative effort under leadership of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR). The update is being conducted in geographic phases with data released for each region as it is finalized. This metadata record covers the first three geographic regions: northeast, east-central, and southern Minnesota. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund. The updated NWI classify wetlands according to the system developed by Cowardin et al. (1979). The data also contains a simplified plant community classification (SPCC) and a simplified hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification. Quality assurance of the data included visual inspection, automated checks for attribute validity and topologic consistency, as well as a formal accuracy assessment based on an independent field verified data set. Further details on the methods employed can be found in the technical procedures document for this project located on the project website (http:\/\/www.dnr.state.mn.us\/eco\/wetlands\/nwi_proj.html ). The updated NWI data are primarily based on spring aerial imagery acquired in 2011 and LiDAR elevation data as well as other modern ancillary data. These data are intended to replace the original 1980s NWI data. NWI data support effective wetland management, protection, and restoration. The data provide a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of wetland policies and management actions. These data are used at all levels of government, as well as by private industry and non-profit organizations for wetland regulation and management, land use and conservation planning, environmental impact assessment, and natural resource inventories. EAST-CENTRAL: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited (DU) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The DNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review. The east-central project area consists of 13 counties including: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Goodhue, Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright Counties. The updated wetland inventory area included complete coverage for all USGS quarter quadrangles that intersect any of these counties (about 7,150 square mile).The NWI classification process for east-central Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation\/editing of the classified image segments. NORTHEAST: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited (DU) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The DNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review. The project area consists of 5 counties in northeast Minnesota including: Cook, Koochiching, Lake, St. Louis, and a portion of Carlton Counties. The project encompasses 1,097 USGS quarter quads covering an area of 14,330 square miles (17% of the state). The NWI classification process for northeast Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation of the classified image segments. Please note that a portion of Koochiching County was completed as a separate pilot project. Those data are not yet included in the greater northeast regional product and will be incorporated after their validation is complete. SOUTHERN: Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Geospatial Services of St. Mary's University of Minnesota (SMUMN) and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The MNDNR Resource Assessment Office provided additional support data processing, field checking, and quality control review. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund. The project area consists of 36 counties in southern Minnesota including: Big Stone, Blue Earth, Brown, Chippewa, Cottonwood, Dodge, Faribault, Fillmore, Freeborn, Houston, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Le Sueur, Lincoln, Lyon, Martin, McLeod, Meeker, Mower, Murray, Nicollet, Nobles, Olmstead, Pipestone, Redwood, Renville, Rock, Sibley, Steele, Swift, Wabasha, Waseca, Watonwan, Winona, and Yellow Medicine Counties. The project encompasses 1,787 USGS quarter quads covering an area of 23,900 square miles (28% of the state). The NWI classification process for southern Minnesota relied on visual image interpretation and other geospatial techniques to identify and classify wetlands using remote sensing data. NOTE: The layer files for this data have been set up to restrict drawing of the data when zoomed out beyond 1:100,000 scale for the east-central region and when zoomed out beyond 1:250,000 scale for the northeast and southern regions. This is, in part, to prevent problems with slow performance with this large dataset. However, the data have also been compressed to speed the drawing performance and this results in a terminal system instability in ArcMap version 10.2 when the east-central data are viewed zoomed out beyond about 1:100,000 scale (1:60,000 scale for the Cowardin symbolized layer). This does not affect the more recent versions of ArcMap such as ArcMap 10.2.2. It also does not affect uncompressed versions of the data.",

"dc_description_s": "The National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP) is an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units for the NPS Natural Resource Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Program. The NPS VIP is managed by the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division and provides baseline vegetation information to the NPS Natural Resource I&M Program. The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NatureServe, and NPS Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MISS) have completed vegetation classification and mapping of MISS for the NPS VIP.Mappers, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to identify and describe vegetation types within the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) and to determine how best to map them by using aerial imagery. The team collected data from 132 vegetation plots within MISS to develop detailed descriptions of USNVC associations. Data from 52 verification sites were also collected to test both the dichotomous key to vegetation associations and the application of vegetation types to a sample set of map polygons. Furthermore, data from 776 accuracy assessment (AA) sites were collected (of which 757 were used to test accuracy of the vegetation map layer). These data sets led to the identification of 45 vegetation association in the USNVC at MISS.A total of 45 map classes were developed to map the vegetation and open water of MISS, including the following: 35 map classes represent natural (including ruderal) vegetation in the USNVC, 7 map classes represent cultural vegetation (agricultural and developed) in the USNVC, and 3 map classes represent non-vegetative open-water bodies (non-USNVC). Features were interpreted from viewing color-infrared digital aerial imagery dated September and October 2012 (during peak leaf-phenology change of trees) via digital onscreen three-dimensional stereoscopic workflow systems in geographic information systems (GIS). The interpreted data were digitally and spatially referenced, thus making the spatial database layers usable in GIS. Polygon units were mapped to either a 0.5 ha or 0.25 ha minimum mapping unit, depending on vegetation type.A geodatabase containing various feature-class layers and tables shows the locations of USNVC vegetation types (vegetation map), vegetation plot samples, verification sites, AA sites, project boundary extent, and aerial image centers. The feature-class layer and relate tables for the vegetation map provides 4,498 polygons of detailed attribute data covering 21,771.6 ha of area, with an average polygon size of 4.8 ha; the vegetation map covers the entire administrative boundary for MISS.Summary reports generated from the vegetation map layer show map classes representing USNVC natural (including ruderal) vegetation associations apply to 4,012 polygons (89.2% of polygons) and cover 8,938.7 ha (41.1%) of the map extent. Of these polygons, the map layer shows MISS to be 27.5% forest and woodland (5,986.2 ha), 1.6% shrubland (353.6 ha), 11.2% herbaceous vegetation (2,431.8 ha), and 0.8% sparse vegetation (163.9 ha). Map classes representing USNVC cultural types apply to 415 polygons (9.2% of polygons) and cover 7,628.5 ha (35.0%) of the map extent. Map classes representing non-vegetative open-water bodies (non-USNVC) apply to 71 polygons (1.6% of polygons) and cover 5,204.4 ha (23.9%) of the map extent.

The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that represents the surface water of the United States using common features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, canals, stream gages, and dams. Polygons are used to represent area features such as lakes, ponds, and rivers; lines are used to represent linear features such as streams and smaller rivers; and points are used to represent point features such as stream gages and dams. Lines also are used to show the water flow through area features such as the flow of water through a lake. The combination of lines is used to create a network of water and transported material flow to allow users of the data to trace movement in downstream and upstream directions. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Minnesota River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds.",

"dc_description_s": "This dataset consists of water demand projections for 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 for municipal public water supply systems in the seven-county metropolitan area. 2004 water demand data is also included to represent baseline water demand; normal climate conditions in 2004 resulted in approximately average per capita water demand. Water demand is expressed as population served by municipal systems, municipal maximum daily and average daily demand, non-municipal average daily demand, domestic (private well) average daily demand, total community average daily demand, municipal per capita demand, and the ratio of municipal maximum daily demand to average daily demand.For its 2010-2030 water supply demand projections, the Council used data submitted in 2008 local comprehensive plans. Where local comprehensive plans did not contain projection data, the water demand projection method outlined in the 2007 Water Supply Planning in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Technical Report was used to forecast water use. While the Council does not have official 2040 and 2050 water use forecasts for each community in the metropolitan area, population for these years was projected based on the amount of remaining developable land and predicted population growth trends between 2000 and 2030. 2040 and 2050 water use was forecast using the same rate of water use for 2030 multiplied by the forecasted population for 2040 and 2050. More information can be found in Appendix E of the Metropolitan Council's 2009 report: Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Regional Groundwater Flow Model Version 2.00, Technical Report in Support of the Metropolitan Area Master Water Supply Plan. This document can be found online at www.metrocouncil.org\/environment\/WaterSupply\/metrogroundwatermodeldatasets.htm. Additional information is presented in the Metropolitan Council 2007 Report to the Minnesota State Legislature: Water Supply Planning in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, found online at www.metrocouncil.org\/environment\/WaterSupply\/WaterSupplyPlanningReport.htm.",

By state rule, permit applicability is based on urbanized area as defined by the latest decennial census, population, and proximity to special receiving waters (e.g., trout streams, Outstanding Resource Value Waters, and impaired waters). In addition, Minnesota requires MS4s located at least partially within an urbanized area that have resident capacity, bed count, or average daily user population of 1,000 or more to obtain a permit. These are referred to as non-traditional MS4s. <br\/><br\/>MS4 owners must establish stormwater pollution prevention programs that include public education and involvement, illicit discharge elimination, construction-site runoff controls, and stormwater best management practices.<br\/>",

"dc_title_s": "Scientific and Natural Areas (SNA) Conservation Opportunity Areas and Marxan Conservation Prioritization: Minnesota",
"dc_description_s": "This data layer maps priority areas for protecting biological diversity. The data was generated using Marxan - the most widely-used decision support software for the design of conservation reserve systems in the world. Marxan has the ability to take primary input information such as the location of rare species, biodiversity areas, or mapped extent of different native plant communities and weigh against other types of information such as conservation constraints against the primary input. It then maps a result that provides the most efficient layout of a conservation system that addresses the primary conservation targets. Marxan operates by creating hypothetical mapping solutions to see how well the areas mapped in each solution provide the most efficient means of creating a conservation reserve system. As applied to this plan, the software creates 300 scenarios using 160-acre cells across each ECS subsection in the state. A cell size of 160 acres was selected since it provides a reasonable level of resolution for a state-level plan and stays within the capacity of the computers processing very large amounts of data. It conducts iterative sampling via 1,000,000 iterations per scenario to create the optimal grouping of cells that efficiently capture enough locations of conservation features to meet the target level of conservation for each designated type of feature within the study area.A target was set for each native plant community type occurring within each subsection. An example would be a target value of capturing 75% of all calcareous fens within an ECS subsection. If a solution set does not meet this goal, it can be penalized, and Marxan will go through the remainder of the 1,000,000 iterations for that scenario trying to create a better solution that captures 75% of calcareous fens. The solution seeks to meet the conservation target and minimize the amount of land required to meet all of the other conservation targets (for other NPC types) also.Other factors are also entered into Marxan such as the following:- Determining whether certain cells should be locked in or out, i.e. sometimes certain cells would always be included or excluded- Lands with high opportunity costs: Prime and Unique Farmland soils (likely to be already farmed or have a high likelihood of being converted to farmland), greater than 4% impervious surfaces in the Twin cities Metropolitan Area, and School Trust Fund lands.- The degree to which cells should be grouped together to create small, discrete sites versus landscape corridorsMarxan will try to avoid selecting cells that have high opportunity costs even if they contain rare conservation features, as this will drive up the total \"cost\" of the solution set. However, some conservation features are so rare that all locations must be selected regardless of cost. Either these features may be included at the expense of other less costly features, or their costs are so high that the selection will be very specific, resulting in virtually no areas peripheral to the conservation feature being selected that could function in a buffering or connecting capacity.One of the most useful functions of Marxan is its ability to sort through different layers of inputs and constraints to generate results at a desired level of aggregation. Marxan also has a \"clumping factor\" input that allows the project to generate results with highly segregated priority areas, or to find the optimal way to create landscape-level \"clumps\" of conservation areas. The latter approach was selected as an adaptation strategy set forth in climate change assessments.Conservation Opportunity AreasOpportunity Areas are a way of further defining the Marxan high priority aggregations as discrete planning areas to focus for conservation efforts. These areas are selected for their capacity to provide the following:- Significant rare resources, native communities, natural features, or biodiversity significance- Partners that are willing to plan, implement, and evaluate conservation actions- Conservation that is motivated by an agreed-upon conservation purpose and set of objectives- Contributions to a conservation network that provides pathways for species mobility, which is particularly critical when addressing climate change concerns Opportunity Areas were only developed for the ECS subsections that had complete MBS data coverage. These Opportunity Areas are detailed in Part 2 of the SNA Strategic Plan.Initially, the boundaries of Conservation Opportunity Areas were drawn to capture the high and highest-priority areas (orange and red zones) from the Marxan output, and in many cases the moderate priority areas (yellow zones). This provided a base area for each Opportunity Area. Additional information layers were added to see how well the Marxan outputs protected rare or diverse conservation features, such as the National Land Cover Data set, the Element Occurrences of Natural Heritage rare features, Ecological Evaluations, and areas of biodiversity significance. Land cover was used as a layer to look at connectivity within high priority areas. This was particularly helpful in areas such as southeastern Minnesota, where strong landform patterns created by ridges and valleys can be used to provide connectivity. Ridges and floodplains are frequently cultivated, but valley side slopes also form a network that provides native forest or goat prairies that provide better species connectivity than cropped lands. Mapping workshops were held with a variety of DNR staff to refine the Opportunity Areas. In most regions, some boundary adjustments were made to include conservation features. Infrequently, an entirely new area was added and a few areas were removed.",

As a subset of the DNR Native Plant Communities dataset, this dataset contains selected native plant community classifications (prairies) that result from the Minnesota Biological Survey (MBS), State Park land cover data, Forestry native plant community data, and Wildlife Management Areas land cover data. It includes polygons representing the highest quality native prairie communities remaining in surveyed areas. These native prairie communities are important areas for conservation.Native plant communities (sometimes also referred to as \"natural communities\") are groups of native plants that interact with each other and their surrounding environment in ways not greatly altered by modern human activity or by introduced plant or animal species. These groups of native species form recognizable units, such as an oak forest, a prairie, or a marsh, that tend to repeat across the landscape and over time.Native plant communities are generally classified and described by considering vegetation, hydrology, land forms, soils, and natural disturbance regimes. The native plant community types and subtypes in this data layer are classified primarily by vegetation and major habitat features.Areas that are not mapped as native plant community polygons primarily represent: 1) land where modern human activities such as farming, overgrazing, wetland drainage, recent logging and residential and commercial development have destroyed or greatly altered the natural vegetation; and 2) native plant community polygons that were below minimal size criteria.Note: some areas that are not mapped are important for conservation. They may include habitat for native plants and animals, corridors for animal movement, buffers surrounding high quality natural areas and open space, and target areas for restoration.",

From 1999 to 2003 land cover boundaries were created by interpreting, delineating, and digitizing vegetation communities and impervious surfaces. The Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (MLCCS)was used to interpret land cover types. MN DNR color infrared photography, Dakota County digital color aerial photography, and Pictometry were used for interpreting vegetation along with the following GIS data sets: national wetland inventory, county biological survey, hydric soils, physical water features, fieldline boundaries, woodline boundaries, and contours. Land cover boundaries were delineated on 1997 Metropolitan Council Digital Ortho Quarter Quads (DOQQ'S) from 1999 to 2000 (1991 United States Geological Survey DOQQ's were used for high water areas that were flooded on the 1997 DOQQ's), on 2000 Metropolitan Council DOQQ's from 2000 to 2002 and on 2002 Dakota County DOQQ's during 2003. Resulting interpreted and delineated land cover polygons were field checked where visible or accessible from roads or public property. Polygon boundaries were then digitized in ArcInfo at a 1:3,000 scale. A Minumum mapping unit of 1 acre was observed for both built-up and semi-natural and natural polygons. Exceptions: feedlots, prairies, stormwater ponds, and many wetlands were mapped at smaller sizes, and a portion of the City of Eagan extending from the southern municipal boundary northwest to 35E and east to Dodd Road to the north and Highway 3 to the south was re-mapped at a 1\/4 acre mmu (only MLCCS 10,000 level codes). Partial updates were completed for: many wetland basins within the Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) in 2006-07 during the WWIA using 2005 and 2006 aerial photography, many wetland basins within the North Cannon River Watershed (poltical boundary) in 2007-08 during the WWIA using 2006 and 2008 aerial photography, the entire Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) in 2009 using 2008 and 2009 aerial photography, a 1 mile buffer area of both sides of all waterways within the North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) in 2010 using 2009 aerial photography, all remaining sections of the North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) in early 2012 using 2011 aerial photography, many areas of Dakota County north of Apple Valley\/Rosemount during 2012 using 2011 aerial photography while spot checking data, all Dakota County FNAP property easements through 2013, and all BWSR approved Wetland Banks in Dakota County through 2013.",

"dc_description_s": "The soil erodibility index shows the relative potential for soils within the MRCCA to erode. The index combines the inherent erodibility of a soil type (K-factor) with the slope on which the soil type is located. The soil erosion index value is derived by multiplying the slope class with the K-Factor resulting in a relative index range from 0.02 to 1.96. The K-factor value was retrieved from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) on 2\/1\/2017. The percent slope was calculated from a 10-meter LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM). LiDAR data for the Twin Cities Metro area was collected in the spring and fall of 2011.The index is only calculated where SSURGO soils data is available. Soil survey data is not available for some areas where there is a history of urban use including use of fill, or areas with restricted access.The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances. Rules regulating the MRCCA were published on December 27, 2016 and became effective January 4, 2017.",

The inventory was called Minarchive and resulted in a searchable website at: http:\/\/minarchive.dnr.state.mn.us\/. The GIS footprints from this project were reviewed and attributes modified in order to make certain that each footprint had a relationship to one or more online exploration documents. These footprints are being made available to assist users in their search for mineral exploration documents in GIS software and\/or online web map applications. A PDF report organized by Minarchive mineral exploration area (Spatial_ID) was developed to give general information on each document as well as provide online links to download PDFs and georeferenced maps.Also included is a related GIS dataset featuring the footprints of selected Minarchive exploration documents georeferenced by the DNR between 2014-2016. This dataset has links to download the selected georeferenced maps. There are many more maps in Minarchive that can be geoferenced. Lastly included is a DNR pilot project that captured GIS data from georeferenced maps in a specific area of Northern Minnesota called the Cook Area. Data collected includes grids, bedrock outrcrops, and various point features such as drill holes or surface samples.GIS Datasets Provided (Shapefiles, Table, and File Geodatabase)1.mineral_exploration_areas.shp - Footprints of Minarchive mineral exploration areas.2.georeferenced_map_footprints.shp - Footprints of selected georeferenced Minarchive maps.3.grids.shp - Cook area pilot project geophysical and geochemical grids4.outcrops.shp - Cook area pilot project bedrock outcrops5.points.shp - Cook area pilot project point features6.minarchive_documents_table.dbf - Table of each indexed Minarchive document record with related footprint.",

"dc_title_s": "Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) Composite: Metro Twin Cities, Minnesota",
"dc_description_s": "The MUSA Composite dataset depicts current and future boundaries of the Urban Service Areas (sewer service areas) based on communities' comprehensive plans for the seven-county metropolitan area of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The dataset does not depict the precise location of current urban services (Sewer service). In other words, the Urban Service Areas designate areas that might be serviced, it does not represent the urban areas that are serviced. The depiction of Urban Service Areas provides a framework in which known urban development and anticipated future development can exist with adequate sewer capacity at efficient service levels. Six other datasets are derived from these data: MUSA_2020, MUSA_2020_Outline, MUSA_2030, MUSA_2030_Outline, MUSA_2040, MUSA_2040_Outline, MUSA_Undesignated (Previously known as Flexible or Floating MUSA), MUSA Undesignated_Reserve (see below). NOTE: As of August 2012, The derived dataset MUSA_2010 is obsolete and no longer generate. However, the data details are still maintained in the MUSA_Composite dataset.Each community (city or township) in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area is required to complete a comprehensive plan for approval by the Metropolitan Council per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). The comprehensive plan must include a depiction of current and future boundaries of the Urban Service Areas (i.e., 2020, 2030, 2040, Post-2040). The Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) shown are compiled from each community's comprehensive plan. It may or may not include amendments to the comprehensive plan. Also, this map shows areas of 'Undesignated MUSA' found in some communities. Generally, Undesignated MUSA represents an areas where an agreed upon acreage of urban sewer service can be added to the current MUSA by 2030. Area added to the current MUSA is to be reported to the Metropolitan Council on an annual basis. As community's complete their 2018 Comprehensive Plans, Undesignated MUSA can represent areas to be added to the current MUSA by 2040.As of March 2011, a new designation area was created specifically to address the agreed upon development plan for southeastern Scott County between the county, the city of Elko New Market and the town of New Market : 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve.' Similar to 'Undesignated MUSA,' this is an area where an agreed upon acreage of urban sewer service can be added to the current MUSA by 2030 and as community's complete their 2018 Comprehensive Plans, Undesignated MUSA can represent areas to be added to the current MUSA by 2040. The distinction between 'Undesignated MUSA' and 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve' is that 'Undesignated MUSA' is an area within a municipal boundary defined by that municipality's comprehensive plan, whereas, 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve' is an area beyond the current municipal boundary (i.e., surrounding township) that is designated in a joint agreement by the city, town, and county to accommodate future municipal growth. Urban sewer services will not be provided to these areas until they have been annexed by the municipality (i.e., Elko New Market). Although the Metropolitan Council provides the majority of the urban sewer service in the seven-county metropolitan area, several smaller, free-standing rural communities in the region (primarily in Carver and Scott Counties), private systems, and independent nations (Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community) provide their own urban services. Where information on their urban service areas are available, it is included in this dataset. Although the information included in this dataset is derived from the communities' 1998 and 2008 comprehensive plans, subsequent plan amendments, annual reporting of MUSA additions from Undesignated MUSA, and is intended to be current within 4 months, for exact MUSA information, please contact the community. When referring to CURRENT MUSA extent, this includes areas up to 2020 MUSA. These data were previously incorporated in the Comprehensive Plan Composite dataset",

"dc_description_s": "This layer contains boundaries of the Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota for each year from 1995 through 1998. Plans are to also add Local Urban Service Area (LUSA) boundaries to this dataset.A MUSA boundary line is the outer edge of the urban area. It is a line agreed to jointly by the Council and local governments through local comprehensive plan reviews. It delimits the outer reaches of regional services for the specified time period. A LUSA boundary line is the outer edge of the urban service are in rural growth centers. Rural growth centers are incorporated areas that currently provide central sewer service and that have planned long-term expansions of their urban service area. These small cities are expected to plan for a balance of housing and jobs to promote self-sufficiency. This service area boundary, like the MUSA, is agreed to jointly by the Council and local governments through local comprehensive plan reviews. It delimits the outer reaches of regional services for the specified time period. Many of the lines that define the MUSA boundary are municipal boundaries. In this layer, these lines have been derived from the County and Minor Civil Divisions layer compiled by the Metropolitan Council. Other lines in this layer have been derived from municipal comprehensive plan maps at a variety of scales and accuracy levels.NOTES: - The lines in this layer are not expected to be as positionally accurate as parcel datasets available from most counties in the Twin Cities area.- Significant errors have been noticed in the original 1995 dataset. These include missing polygons and lines that differ significantly from the parcel boundaries that actually define the MUSA. These errors will be fixed as they are encountered. See Horizontal Positional Accuracy for more information.- Additionally, areas included in the MUSA in any particular year can, at times, be difficult to determine from maps submitted to the Council prior to 1998, and do not necessarily match maps from previous years.- Some communities have 'undesignated' or 'floating' MUSAs. That is, they may have a large or undefined area within which a specific amount of land may be added to the MUSA within a given period of time. Thus, the acreage of additional MUSA has been approved by the council, but the location of that acreage will be determined in the future. These 'undesignated' or 'floating' MUSAs are not represented in this layer until specific locations are identified.",

The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. (See section 5 of the metadata). The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate\/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels.

The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. (See section 5 of the metadata). The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate\/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels.

The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. (See section 5 of the metadata). The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate\/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties will polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.Polygon and point counts for each county are as follows (based on the January 2008 dataset unless otherwise noted): Anoka = 130,675 polygons, 130,675 pointsCarver = 37,715 polygons, 37,715 pointsDakota = 135,771 polygons, 149,925 pointsHennepin = 359,042 polygons, 425,562 pointsRamsey = 149,093 polygons, 166,939 pointsScott = 55,242 polygons, 55,242 pointsWashington = 98,812 polygons, 10,687pointsThis is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are identical for the point and polygon datasets. Not all attributes fields are populated by each county.

The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. Not all attributes are populated for all counties.This is an annual version of the MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset that can be used with other annual versions to do change analysis and time series investigations. This dataset is intended to contain all updates to each county's parcel data through the end of 2002. It was originally published as the \"January 1, 2003\" version of the dataset. See the Currentness Reference below and the Entity and Attribute information in Section 5 for more information about the dates for specific aspects of the dataset.Some counties have also made available a parcel points dataset that includes the same attribute fields. This is done to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.",

Core needs this dataset are intended to satisfy include:- Vehicular routing;- Address geocoding;- Next Generation 911 call routing and location validation;- Emergency services dispatching;- Linear referencing uses;- Cartographic representation of road features;The MRCC encourages other counties and stakeholders across Minnesota to build upon the work of the MRCC and not have to replicate the process of model development. The MRCC does not claim to have the full knowledge of the unique road data needs to be anticipated from stakeholders in Greater Minnesota such as national and state forest roadway, tribal nation roadways and so on. The MRCC endeavors to have this effort augment and support larger statewide road dataset development efforts in the future.For specific questions regarding centerline alignments or attributes, please contact the county belowAnoka: https:\/\/www.anokacounty.us\/315\/GISCarver: gis@co.carver.mn.usDakota: gis@co.dakota.mn.usHennepin: gis.info@hennepin.usRamsey: RCGISMetaData@co.ramsey.mn.usScott: gis@co.scott.mn.usWashington: surveyor@co.washington.mn.us",

In 2003 the DNR and the Met Council conducted a follow-up natural resource assessment and created a Regional Significant Ecological Resources data layer (http:\/\/deli.dnr.state.mn.us\/metadata.html?id=L390002900201). The DNR's regional plant ecologist (Hannah Texler) created the first draft of the MeCC data using the RSEA data and the MCBS data as reference layers, drawing on PRIM maps or digitizing on screen. The corridors have subsequently been refined by the MeCC partners and ecological experts in each county. The data was digitized between 1:24,000 and 1:10,000, using USGS quad maps and the DNR Public Recreation Info Maps (PRIM) for location references.",

"dc_description_s": "This data layer represents areas with varying levels of native biodiversity that may contain high quality native plant communities, rare plants, rare animals, and\/or animal aggregations. Initially, boundaries of sites are determined by review of aerial photography in order to identify potential areas of native biodiversity based on native vegetation. In subsequent field investigations, MCBS assesses the ecological characteristics of the site and the presence of rare species. A biodiversity significance rank is assigned on the basis of the number of rare species, the quality of the native plant communities, size of the site, and context within the landscape. Following field investigations, site boundaries sometimes are revised, or sites added, to incorporate critical habitat for rare plants and rare animals. In these instances, the quality of native plant communities is not the primary criteria for ranking the site. MCBS Sites that are found to be disturbed are retained in the layer as negative data and are given the Biodiversity Significance rank of \"Below.\" Those disturbed areas within MCBS Sites and all areas outside MCBS Sites are lands where native plant communities have been seriously altered or destroyed by human activities such as farming, recent logging, draining, and development.",

Layers included in this dataset are listed below along with a description about how they were created and their source.Dredged Material Placement Site - Contains point locations for materials dredged from river channels. The points represent sediments accumulated in the channel between maintenance dredging. The sites were obtained from Upper Mississippi River maps found on the US Army Corps Engineers website. These maps, in conjunction with aerial photography, were used for digitizing placement.Gage Station - Contains point locations for Gage Stations along the rivers. The source of this data was the Upper Mississippi River maps found on the US Army Corps Engineers website. These maps, in conjunction with aerial photos, were used in digitizing placement of points.Rocks - Contains point locations for large rock hazards found in metro rivers. Sources for this data were the MNDNR Metro Area Rivers Guide, 2010 maps and Mississippi River Companion maps from the National Park Service. Point placement was digitized using these maps along with aerial photography. Closed River Zone - Contains a polygon of the work zone area where the St Croix River Bridge is being constructed. The zone is approximately 1 mile long and spans the width of the river. This zone is temporary but is in effect until the bridge is completed in 2016. Data source is from MNDOT, WISDOT and aerial photography.No Wake Zone - Contains polygons representing areas where No Wake Zones are in effect. Source for this data was the MNDNR Metro Area Rivers Guide, 2010 and aerial photography. Rapids - Contains polygons representing areas of River Rapids.

Nine land use\/land cover classes, interpreted from high altitude air photos, are recorded for each 40-acre parcel in the state. These classes include: forested; cultivated; water; marsh; urban residential; extractive; pasture and open; urban non-residential or mixed residential; and transportation. MLMIS data sets were created by grid cell coding a value for each 40-acre parcel in the state. The file was later subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells and spatially corrected to provide improved geographic reference. However, this processing step does not improve on the 40-acre resolution of the original data set.",

"dc_description_s": "The Land Surface Temperature (LST) raster dataset is a dataset derived from a satellite image from Landsat 8 to show the land surface temperature for the seven-county metropolitan region of the Twin Cities, in degrees Fahrenheit. In essence, this map shows how hot the ground was to the touch at any given location. This satellite image was taken at 11:59 am CDT on July 22, 2016. At this time, the air temperature was 90F with a heat index of 90.3F, as taken at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, 2016). This was the third day of a regional heat wave , and while temperatures overnight had dipped down to around 74F, temperatures had climbed up to a maximum temperature of 97F  by around 5-6pm, resulting in the hottest day in roughly three years (Midwestern Regional Climate Center, 2016). The original thermal image was taken at a 100 x 100 meter resolution, but was re-scaled and processed at the 30 x 30 meter scale. (Landsat 8 collects image data at a spatial resolution of 30 meters (visible, NIR, SWIR); 100 meters (thermal); and 15 meters (panchromatic).)<br\/><br\/>This Landsat 8 raster image was first used to create a NDVI raster dataset. Using that NDVI dataset with Bands 10 and 11 of the Landsat 8 raster dataset, a Land Surface Temperature raster can be derived. That raster is further processed from celsius to fahrenheit, then clipped to the 7-county metropolitan area, and all water bodies removed from the final image. <br\/><br\/>The LST values without regional water bodies is the primary basis for the Metropolitan Council Climate Vulnerability Assessment Report. Part of this report specifically considers the urban heat island effect, or the effect of human activity and the built environment on increases in urban temperature on human life, and as water has different heat retention properties than most land surfaces, we chose to do our analysis without regional water bodies. It should be noted that the lowest original LST values were water bodies, and so by removing the water bodies from the map the minimum LST value raised 0.6F. This is not particularly significant, except that it would minimally affect which values would be highlighted in the third layer of this package.",

"dc_description_s": "Southeastern Minnesota is part of the Upper Mississippi Valley Karst (Hedges and Alexander, 1985) that includes southwestern Wisconsin and northeastern Iowa. Karst lands in Minnesota are developed in Paleozoic carbonate and sandstone bedrock. A significant sandstone karst has developed in Pine County (Shade and others, 2001). Most surficial karst features such as sinkholes are found only in those areas with less than fifty feet of sedimentary cover over bedrock surface (Gao and others, 2002).Since the early 1980s, the Minnesota Geological Survey and Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota have been mapping karst features and publishing various versions of their results in the form of 1:100,000 scale County Geologic Atlases. In the mid 1990s, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources was assigned responsibility for the hydrogeology portions of the County Atlases and is now responsible for the karst mapping. Dalgleish and Alexander (1984), Alexander and Maki (1988), Witthuhn and Alexander (1995), Green and others (1997), Shade and others (2001), and Tipping and others (2001) published sinkhole distribution maps for Winona, Olmsted, Fillmore Counties, Leroy Township, Pine and Wabasha Counties respectively. Published atlases of Washington, Dakota, and the counties of the Twin Cites Metro area contain limited information on sinkhole occurrences.A karst feature database of Southeastern Minnesota has been developed that allows sinkhole and other karst feature distributions to be displayed and analyzed across existing county boundaries in a GIS environment. The central DBMS is a relational GIS-based system interacting with three modules: spatial operation, spatial analysis, and hydrogeological modules. Data tables are stored in a Microsoft ACCESS 2000 DBMS and linked to corresponding ArcMap shapefiles. The current Karst Feature Database of Southeastern Minnesota was put on a Citrix Window 2000 server accessible to researchers and planners through networked interfaces.The karst inventory points were point features such as sinkholes, springs, and stream sinks extracted from the karst feature database of Southeastern Minnesota. This research was supported with funding from the Minnesota Department of Health.",

Waterbodies declared impaired prior to 2016 are also included in this dataset unless they have been delisted. The waterbodies included in the dataset were submitted to EPA in January, 2017 as part of the impaired waters list. EPA evaluates the list and either approves it as-is or modifies it, which may result in changes to this spatial data. Note that for the purpose of submitting the impaired waters list to EPA, waterbodies partially or wholly within Indian reservation boundaries are published in separate datasets. The MPCA still considers these waters impaired and has an interest in restoring them. The MPCA respectfully requests that the waters partially or wholly within Indian reservations be symbolized differently on map products so that viewers can differentiate them from waters not intersecting Indian reservations. These waterbodies are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In cases where the NHD does not include a feature that MPCA has assessed, a feature is added by MPCA. Since the impaired waterbodies are a small subset of the NHD, only that subset is included in the dataset. This dataset includes impaired waterbodies that have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA.",

These districts were in place from 1976 until 2017, when EO 79-19 was superseded by Minnesota Rules, chapter 6106. The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances. The MRCCA is home to a full range of residential neighborhoods and parks, as well as river-related commerce, industry, and transportation. Though the MRCCA has been extensively developed, many intact and remnant natural areas remain, including bluffs, islands, floodplains, wetlands, riparian zones, and native aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna. EO-79-19 established four districts, each with dimensional standards for river and bluff setbacks, and building height. The purpose of this map is to delineate the physical boundaries for each of these four historic districts.",

"dc_description_s": "In 1934, the Federal Housing Administration created a financial mortgage system that rated mortgage risks for properties based on various criteria but was centered on race and ethnicity. This rating system propagated racial segregation that in many ways persists today.The FHA Underwriting Handbook incorporated color-coded real estate investment maps that classified neighborhoods based on assumptions about a community, primarily their racial and ethnic composition, and not on the financial ability of the residents to satisfy the obligations of a mortgage loan. These maps, created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) were used to determine where mortgages could or could not be issued. The neighborhoods were categoriezed into four types:Type A : Best - newer or areas stil in demandType B : Still Desirable - areas expected to remain stable for many yearsType C : Definitely Declining - areas in transitionType D : Hazardous - older areas considered riskyNeighborhoods shaded red were deemed too hazardous for federally-back loans. These \"red-lined\" neighborhoods were where most African American residents lived. Many have argued tha the HOLC maps institutionalized discriminating lending practices which not only perpetuated racial segregation but also led to neighborhood disinvestment. Today, neighborhoods classified as Type C and Type D in 2934 make up the majority of neighborhoods in 2016 that are Areas of Concentrated Poverty where 50% or More are People of Color.",

"dc_title_s": "Generalized Land Use Historical (1984, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016): Metro Twin Cities, Minnesota",
"dc_description_s": "The Historical Generalized Land Use dataset encompasses the seven county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota. The dataset was developed by the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental organization that deals, in part, with regional issues and long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The data were interpreted from 1984, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016 air photos and other source data, with additional assistance from county parcel data and assessor's information. The Metropolitan Council has routinely developed generalized land use for the Twin Cities region since 1984 to support its statutory responsibilities and assist in long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The Council uses land use information to monitor growth and to evaluate changing trends in land consumption for various urban purposes. The Council uses the land use trend data in combination with its forecasts of households and jobs to plan for the future needs and financing of Metropolitan services (i.e. Transit, Wastewater Services, etc.). Also, in concert with individual local units of government, the land use and forecast data are used to evaluate expansions of the metropolitan urban service area (MUSA). The Council does not specifically survey the rights-of-way of minor highways, local streets, parking lots, railroads, or other utility easements. The area occupied by these uses is included with the adjacent land uses, whose boundaries are extended to the centerline of the adjacent rights-of way or easements. The accuracy of Council land use survey data is suitable for regional planning purposes, but should not be used for detailed area planning, nor for engineering work. Until 1997, the Metropolitan Council had manually interpreted aerial photos on mylar tracing paper into a 13-category land-use classification system to aggregate and depict changing land use data. In 1997, with technological advances in GIS and improved data, the Metropolitan Council was able to delineate land uses from digital aerial photography with counties' parcel and assessor data and captured information with straight 'heads-up' digitizing with GIS software. Also, understanding that land use data collected and maintained at the county and city level are collected at different resolutions using different classification schemes, the Metropolitan Council worked with local communities and organizations to develop a cooperative solution to integrate the Council's land use interpretation with a generally agreed upon regional classification system. By 2000, the Metropolitan Council had not only expanded their Generalized Land Use Classification system to include 22 categories, but had refined how they categorized land (removing all ownership categories) to reflect actual use. See the Entities and Atributes section of the metadata for a detailed description of each of the land use categories and available subcategories. With the completion of the 2016 Generalized Land Use dataset, regional and local planners have the ability to map changes in urban growth and development in a geographic information system (GIS) database. By tracking land use changes, the Metropolitan Council and local planners can better visualize development trends and anticipate future growth needs. NOTE ABOUT COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: It is important to understand the changes between land use inventory years and how to compare recent land use data to historical data. In general, over the land use years, more detailed land use information has been captured. Understanding these changes can help interpret land use changes and trends in land consumption. For detailed category definitions, specific land use comparisons and how best to compare the land uses between 1984 and 2016, please refer to the Attribute Accuracy or the Data Quality section of the metadata. It is also important to note that changes in data collection methodology also effects the ability to compare land use years: - In 2000, the land use categories were modified to more accurately reflect the use of the land rather than ownership. Although this has minimal effect on associating categories between 1997 and 2000, is may have had an affect on some particular land use. For example, land owned by a community or county but had no apparent active use could have been classified as 'Public\/ Semi-Public' prior to 2000. In 2000, land with no apparent use, regardless of who owns it, is classified as 'Undeveloped.' - With better resolution of air photos beginning in 2000, the incorporation of property information from county assessors and the use of more accurate political boundaries (particularly on the exterior boundaries of the region), positive impacts were made on the accuracy of new land use delineations between pre-2000 land use data and data collected in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016. With the improved data, beginning in 2000, a greater effort to align land use designations, both new and old, to correspond with property boundaries (county parcels) where appropriate. In addition, individual properties were reviewed to assess the extent of development. In most cases, if properties under 5 acres were assessed to be at least 75% developed, then the entire property was classified as a developed land use (not 'Undeveloped'). As a result of these realignments and development assessments, changes in land use between early land use years (1984-1997) and more recent years (2000-2016) will exist in the data that do NOT necessarily represent actual land use change. These occurrences can be found throughout the region. There are also numerous known deficiencies in the datasets. Some known deficiencies are specific to a particular year while others may span the entire time series. For more details, please refer to Attribute Accuracy of the Data Quality section of the metadata.",

The table contains acreage totals by municipality for the years of 1970, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1990 & 1997. The acreage totals are given by County-MCD. County-MCD (field name ''COMCD'') is defined as the portion of a Minor Civil Division (municipality) that resides within a county. Most, but not all MCDs reside entirely within one county. Totals are also provided for acres inside and outside the Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) for certain categories in 1990 and 1997.The acreage totals for 1984, 1990 & 1997 were derived from the Generalized Land Use - Historical GIS layer. See the metadata for that layer for an explanation of the methodology and procedures used to create it.In general, this dataset contains the categories of: single-family residential, multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, public\/semi-public, airports, parks & recreation, vacant\/agricultural, highways, open water bodies, farm homesteads, industrial parks not developed, and public land not developed. In 1997 the classes of Extractive and Public Industrial were added.- Prior to 1984, very little information exists to document the methods used to calculate the land use acreage totals.- The municipal boundaries information used for acreage calculations has changed over the years. Some of this change reflects actual changes in corporate boundaries, other changes reflect new depictions of the same municipal boundaries.- Categories used for summarizing land use acreage as well as the definitions of those categories have not remained completely consistent over time.- Acreage totals are thought to get less accurate as they get older.- Many problems have been found in the 1984 data and many more are likely to exist.- The 1990 data uses a 2000 MUSA as defined in 1990 while the 1997 data MUSA definition is as of October of 1998.",

"dc_title_s": "FEMA Digital Flood Rate Insurance Maps (DFIRM): Minnesota",
"dc_description_s": "The Federal Emergency Managment Agency and the MNDNR produce Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM) for selected counties in the state. These maps are often referred to as FEMA Floodplain maps.A DFIRM is the offical digital map of a community on which FEMA has delineated the special flood hazard areas, i.e., the floodplain areas where flood insurance is required for loans and where communities will administer floodplain regulations. (Note: Communities may regulate additional flood prone areas that are not on the FIRM).Here are some of the feature classes included in the MNDNR's publication of the DFIRM Dataset:FEMA DFIRM Base Flood ElevationsThe Base Flood Elevation (BFE) table is required for any digital data where BFE lines will be shown on the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Normally, if there are any riverine AE zones, BFE lines are required. The BFE table contains information about the BFEs within a study area. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. BFE lines indicate the rounded whole-foot water-surface elevation of the 1-percent-annual-chance flood. The spatial elements representing BFE features are lines extending from Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) boundary to SFHA boundary. The BFE lines will have no visible gaps or overshoots between the SFHA boundary and the end of the BFE line at the publication scale of the DFIRM. However, the ends of the BFE lines are not necessarily snapped precisely to the SFHA boundary. Each BFE is represented by a single line. While BFE lines are depicted as wavy lines on the hardcopy FIRM, they should be primarily straight lines in the spatial data, although they may bend consistent with procedures described in Volume 1 of these Guidelines.FEMA DFIRM Flood Hazard ZonesFEMA flood hazard delineations are used by FEMA to designate the SFHA and for insurance rating purposes. These data are the flood hazard areas that are or will be depicted on the FIRM. FEMA DFIRM Panel Scheme PolygonsThis layer contains information about the FIRM panel areas. The spatial entities representing FIRM panels are polygons. The polygon for the FIRM panel corresponds to the panel neatlines. As a result, the panels are generally rectangular. In situations where a portion of a panel lies outside of the jurisdiction being mapped, the user must refer to the S_POL_AR table to determine the portion of the panel area where the DFIRM database shows the effective flood hazard data for the mapped jurisdiction.FEMA DFIRM Cross SectionsFEMA Cross Sections are required for any Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map database where cross sections are shown on the FIRM. Normally any FIRM that has associated flood profiles has cross sections. The corresponding attribute table contains information about cross section lines. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. These lines represent the locations of channel surveys performed for input into the hydraulic model used to calculate flood elevations. These locations are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. All cross sections for which a spatial location is available should be included in this table. The spatial elements representing cross sections are lines generally extending from outside the floodplain, across the entire floodplain and out the other side. Each cross section should be represented by a single line feature without the hexagons shown on each end on the hardcopy map. The location and shape of the lines should depict as accurately as possible the position of the cross section used. This is a modified Standard DFIRM Database table that includes Standard DFIRM Database items and Enhanced Database items. All items after SOURCE_CIT are Enhanced. The Enhanced DFIRM Database must contain all modeled cross sections, whether they are printed on the FIRM or not.Extensive information regarding the source data can be found in these two documents:FEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part A.pdfFEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part B.pdf",

This version of the dataset reflects boundary changes through 12\/01\/15, as well as changes resulting from the transfer of Alliant Energy's service territories to 12 southern Minnesota cooperatives in early 2016.",

The first condition includes soil mapping units (SSURGO) where the weighted average Ksat for the profile between 0 - 5 feet exceeds 10 m\/sec. The NRCS provided MDA a table of areas with Ksat that could be linked to the SSURGO data. Ksat is a physical property of the soil which quantitatively describes the soil's capacity to transmit water which can be estimated through direct measurements. A threshold value of 10 m\/sec was used because Ksat values greater than or equal to 10 are identified as 'high and very high' water movement through the soil according to the USDA NRCS National Soil Survey Handbook. The second and third conditions are whether karst (DNR) or bedrock (DNR) is located near the land surface.

(The following text is taken from the: Minnesota Land Cover Classification System User Manual, July 2003, MN DNR, Central Region.) MLCCS integrates classification of cultural features, non-native vegetation, natural and semi-natural vegetation into a comprehensive land cover classification system. MLCCS is based heavily on the US National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) and Minnesota's Native Vegetation: A Key to Natural Communities, version 1.5. The MLCCS uses the natural community terminology developed by the MN DNR Natural Heritage and Nongame Research Program (NHNRP). To find out further about the MLCCS, refer to the Minnesota Land CoverClassification System website.(http:\/\/www.dnr.state.mn.us\/mlccs\/index.html).",

Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher biotic integrity. Attributes correspond to the most recent IBI survey for each lake.An IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) is a biologically-based, multi-metric method for measuring the integrity of aquatic systems. Minnesota DNR Fisheries Research has developed a fish-based lake IBI that incorporates fish data collected by various methods (trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seines, and backpack electrofishing units) into 8-15 metrics in three categories: species richness, community assemblage, and trophic composition (see Section 5: Attributes). Each metric represents an aspect of the biological assemblage structure, function, or other measurable characteristic that changes in some predictable way with increased human-induced stress. Fish IBI scores respond to differences in land use patterns, trophic state, and aquatic vegetation.Validation studies indicate that the fish-based lake IBI scores function as a measure of fish community response to human disturbance across a gradient of lakes. Continuing work by DNR Fisheries will expand the application of this IBI to more lake types and will validate this tool as a viable method for assessing lake impairment as part of Minnesota's 303(d) Impaired Waters assessments. These scores should be considered as '' and are subject to change as the IBI tools are further developed and refined. This dataset only includes lakes over 100 acres and within lake classes 20-43, with few exceptions for lakes very close to 100 acres. Additional scores will be added to this dataset annually. For more reference information, see (Section 5: Attributes -- Detailed Citation). Related table: env_ibi_lakes_all_surveys_events_polygon_relate IBI scores for additional years can be found in this table.To access related table records:Open the layer attribute table and select a lake polygon recordFrom the Related Table dropdown (2nd icon on bar just above table), choose table Lake IBI Scores: To IBI Scores - All Surveys The related table will open and the corresponding records for the selected lake will be highlighted. Note: You can also select records from the related table and find the lakes that correspond to those records by reversing the process above (i.e., Choose Related Tables dropdown (2nd icon), choose table Lake IBI Scores: Back to IBI Lakes) You can also access scores from all years by clicking on the lake of interest with the Identify Tool and expanding the related tabular information.",

"dc_description_s": "This layer was created to identify Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance (LPSS) within Minnesota. Available lake data were analyzed to classify lakes based on sensitivity to nutrient pollution. Phosphorus sensitivity was estimated for each lake by predicting how much water clarity would be reduced with additional phosphorus loading to the lake. A phosphorus sensitivity significance index was formulated to prioritize lakes as they relate to Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's (MPCA) policy objective of focusing on high quality, unimpaired lakes at greatest risk of becoming impaired. The phosphorus sensitivity significance index, which is a function of phosphorus sensitivity, lake size, lake total phosphorus concentration, proximity to MPCA's phosphorus impairment thresholds, and watershed disturbance, was used to determine the lake's Priority Class.The goal of this list was to objectively prioritize lakes based on their sensitivity to phosphorus pollution. Lakes identified as nutrient-impaired or proposed for nutrient impairment listing are also included.Many Minnesota lakes have not been sampled for lake phosphorus, and this list will be periodically revised as additional data become available. For a detailed description of criteria and analysis used, see: Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance - 04\/18\/2017 (pdf, 1.8 MB)",

"dc_description_s": "This layer shows lakes meeting criteria for Lakes of Biological Significance (LBS). Lakes were identified and classified by DNR subject matter experts on objective criteria for four community types (aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, birds). Unique plant or animal presence was the primary measure of a lake's biological significance. Lakes were rated and grouped for each of the following communities: aquatic plants, fish, birds, and amphibians. Lakes were assigned one of three biological significance classes (outstanding, high, or moderate), which are defined in Section 5: Attributes (below). Many Minnesota lakes have not been sampled for plants and\/or animals, so this list of lakes will be periodically revised as additional biological data become available.The goal of this list was to identify lakes that exhibit the highest quality features within any of the four assessed biological communities (as opposed to identification of lakes that exhibit diversity across communities). Therefore, a lake needed to meet criteria for only one of the community types (aquatic plants, fish, birds, amphibians) to be identified as a Lake of Biological Significance. Occurrences of high-quality features within the community types determined the biological significance rank.For a detailed description of criteria and analysis used, see: <a href=\"ftp:\/\/ftp.gisdata.mn.gov\/pub\/gdrs\/data\/pub\/us_mn_state_dnr\/env_lakes_of_biological_signific\/metadata\/lakes_of_biological_significance_criteria_20150423.pdf\"Lakes of Biological SIgnificance Criteria and Analysis 20150423 (pdf, 38k)",

"dc_description_s": "This dataset supports planning related to policies that address density and activity in the 2040 Transportation Policy Plan (TPP). It includes geographic spatial features with applicable density policies and a separate relational data table that provides estimated Activity Levels for select geographies. Additional detail about these policies, including their application, are available in the Density & Activity Near Transit Fact Sheet in the Local Planning Handbook.<br\/><br\/>The geographic file indicates where densityrequirements apply related to transit. They include station areas along existing transitways, transitways under construction, and transitways where the locations of future stations have been finalized. It also applies to stations along Arterial BRT and along local bus routes that are part of Metro Transit's High Frequency Network. Density policy varies based on the type of transit and\/or Community Designations in Thrive MSP 2040.<br\/><br\/>The relational data table includes accompanying information on Activity Levels for locations where this policy applies. Activity refers to land uses that can generate trips on transit. The TPP includes a guideline for minimum activity of a combined 7,000 total residents, jobs, and\/or students. This Activity Level guideline does not apply to Arterial BRT or local bus routes that are part of the High Frequency Network. The table relates to the geographic file with the UNIQUE_ID field (Station name + Community Name). For stations that exist within more than one community, the table has an addition record with the station total. <br\/><br\/>Transit spatial features are the unique combination of transit station areas and municipalities. These features are defined based on the proximity to transit stations or to local bus routes on the High Frequency Network. In the case of Fixed\/Dedicated Transitways and Highway Bus Rapid Transit, the proximity is based on half-mile radius from a centroid of the stations platform locations. In the case of Arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the proximity is quarter-mile radius from each bus stop centroid. Centroids are based on existing infrastructure locations or the approximate location of future transit stations. In the case of local bus routes on the High Frequency Network, the distance is quarter-mile on either side of the route.<br\/><br\/>Transit spatial features are transformed in three ways. Overlapping features are divided so that the data set only includes mutually exclusive features with geographic areas attributed to one station or another. However, if features with different density policies overlap, the feature with the higher density requirement supersedes the other. Features are also divided where they cross municipal boundaries. For data simplification, feature areas that are less than 4% of the total feature (i.e, station area) have been included in the feature area of the adjacent municipality.<br\/><br\/>Please note that this dataset will be periodically updated. This will occur with changes to transitway priorities, programs, and funding availability. This includes anticipated changes with the 2018 Update to the TPP.

"dc_description_s": "This is a lookup table containing various data related to cities, townships, unorganized territories (CTUs) and any divisions created by county boundaries splitting them. These are termed Minor Civil Division (MCDs) by the Census Bureau. The table encompases the Twin Cities 7-county metropolitan area. It is intended to be a Council wide master lookup table for these entites. It contains official federal and state unique identifiers for CTUs and MCDs as well as identifiers created and used by other organizations. The table also contains historical MCDs dating back to the 1990s and a few other non-MCD records that are of importance to Met. Council use of this table.The County CTU Lookup Table relates to the Counties and Cities & Townships, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area dataset here: https:\/\/gisdata.mn.gov\/dataset\/us-mn-state-metc-bdry-metro-counties-and-ctus - On 5\/28\/2014 a new field was added to reflect the new community designations defined in the Council's Thrive MSP 2040 regional plan - COMDES2040- On 3\/17\/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lake St. Croix Beach was incorrect. It was changed from 2394379 to 2395599 to match GNIS.- On 3\/17\/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lilydale was incorrect. It was changed from 2394457 to 2395708 to match GNIS.- On 11\/9\/2010 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Crystal was incorrect. It was changed from 2393541 to 2393683 to match GNIS.- Effective April 2008, a change was made in GNIS to match the FIPS place codes to the \"civil\" feature for each city instead of the \"populated place\" feature. Both cities and townships are now \"civil\" features within GNIS. This means that the official GNIS unique ID for every city in Minnesota has changed. - As of January 1, 2006, the five digit FIPS 55-3 Place codes that were used as unique identifiers in this dataset (CTU_CODE and COCTU_CODE fields) were officially retired by the Federal governement. They are replaced by a set of integer codes from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS_CODE field). Both codes will be kept in this database, but the GNIS_CODE is considered the official unique identifier from this point forward. The GNIS codes are also slated to become official ANSI codes for these geographic features. While GNIS treats these codes as 6 to 8 digit integer data types, the Census Bureau formats them as 8 digit text fields, right justified with leading zeros included.- The Census Bureau will continue to create FIPS 55 Place codes for new cities and townships through the 2010 Census. After that, no new FIPS 55 codes will be created. Note that for townships that wholly incorporate into cities, the same FIPS 55 code will be used for the new city. (GNIS creates a new ID for the new city.)- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a Census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county. Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.- A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States. In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories. All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area. The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).- Some cities are split between two counties. Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.- Prior to the 2000 census, the FIPS Place code for the City of Greenwood in Hennepin County was changed from 25928 to 25918. This dataset reflects that change.",

It was changed from 2394379 to 2395599 to match GNIS.- On 3\/17\/2011 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Lilydale was incorrect. It was changed from 2394457 to 2395708 to match GNIS.- On 11\/9\/2010 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Crystal was incorrect. It was changed from 2393541 to 2393683 to match GNIS.- Effective April 2008, a change was made in GNIS to match the FIPS place codes to the \"civil\" feature for each city instead of the \"populated place\" feature. Both cities and townships are now \"civil\" features within GNIS. This means that the official GNIS unique ID for every city in Minnesota has changed. - The five digit CTU codes in this dataset are identical to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) ''Place'' codes. They are also used by the Census Bureau and many other organizations and are proposed as a MN state data coding standard.- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county. Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.- The boundary line data for this dataset comes from each county.- A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States. In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories. All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area. The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).- Some cities are split between two counties. Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.- Prior to the 2000 census, the FIPS Place code for the City of Greenwood in Hennepin County was changed from 25928 to 25918.

Base maps that were referenced include the Minnesota County Biological Survey, the Regionally Significant Ecological Areas, DNR Public Recreation Information Map, 2003 Farm Service Agency color aerial photos, and various lakes and rivers data sets. Base maps were overlain and polygons developed in areas where there was a high density of mapped features: MCBS plant communities, RSEA, WMA. The resulting polygons were assessed for the connectivity. Stream connections were primarily used to create either conceptual and \/ or functional corridors connecting these polygons. Due to local geology, this may lead to connectivity along only one axis. Where necessary to create connectivity along the opposing axis, additional connections were created using both RSEA and FSA aerial photos along areas not served by surface water connections. Finally, the polygons were visually checked against the FSA aerial photos to adjust for areas that have been developed and to adjust for roadways and other limitations.The southeast analysis also used steep slope areas, riparian areas, and geological edges.",

Data in the Biotics Database are maintained according to established Natural Heritage Methodology developed by NatureServe and The Nature Conservancy. The core of the Biotics Database is made up of Element Occurrence (EO) records of rare plant and animal species, animal aggregations, native plant communities, and geologic features. An Element is a unit of biological diversity, such as a species, subspecies, or a native plant community. An EO is an area of land and\/or water in which an Element is, or was, present, and which has practical conservation value for the Element (e.g. species or community) as evidenced by potential continued (or historical) presence and\/or regular recurrence at a given location. Source Features are the mapped representation of observations of rare features. Source Features are then evaluated using biological standards, and grouped into EOs as appropriate.This data set contains a point for each Calcareous Fen (DNR List of Known Calcareous Fens) Source Feature in the Biotics database, and selected attributes from the Source Feature record and it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds linked Element Occurrence (EO) record.",

The attribute for the buffer width requirement is derived from three different classification attributes: (1) the Minnesota DNR's Public Waters Inventory classification, (2) the DNR assigned shoreland classification, and (3) public open drainage system data (also referred to as open ditches) established under Minnesota Statute (M.S.) 103E and provided by local drainage authorities. The DNR Commissioner has validated the authenticity of this map for purposes described in M.S. 103F.48. Public waters are all lakes, wetlands and watercourses that meet the criteria set forth in M.S. 103G.005, subd. 15 and are designated on public waters inventory maps. Public water wetlands without DNR shoreland classifications are excluded from the buffer map. The DNR coordinated with counties and watershed districts to identify public ditches that require a buffer.The buffer protection map helps landowners identify buffer protection requirements, under Minnesota's Buffer Law. Public ditches require a 16.5-foot buffer and public waters require a 50-foot average buffer; public ditches that are also public watercourses require a 16.5-foot buffer unless the DNR assigned a specific shoreland classification, in which case a 50-foot average buffer is required. Local ordinances may require wider buffers. This map displays minimum standards and is not intended to affect existing local controls that are more restrictive than these requirements. Furthermore, the buffer map does not depict \"other waters\" to be addressed by local water plans and does not identify locations where local Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) have selected an alternate water quality practice.",

"dc_description_s": "The Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program (MAWQCP) is a voluntary opportunity for farmers and agricultural landowners to take the lead in implementing conservation practices that protect our water. Those who implement and maintain approved farm management practices will be certified and in turn obtain regulatory certainty for a period of ten years. The program is the product of a state-federal partnership that includes the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program was initially piloted in four distinct regions of the state; these areas represented a diversity of Minnesota's agricultural landscapes and cropping systems, differences in water resource concerns and also leverage the strength of existing local partnerships. The pilot areas include: Elm Creek in Cottonwood, Faribault, Jackson, Martin and Watonwan counties, the Middle Sauk River in Stearns County, Whiskey Creek in Otter Tail and Wilkin counties, and the Whitewater River in Olmsted, Wabasha and Winona counties. In June and July 2015 the program was expanded first to several counties and then to the entire state of Minnesota.

The Regionally Significant Natural Resource Area scores are determined by examining important ecological attributes of the natural resource patches, including size, shape, cover type diversity, adjacent land use. The results represent a probability that the modeled conditions exist in any given area, due to limitations of the data layers. The dataset was created from LandSat land cover images.",

It delineates UA and UC boundaries to encompass densely settled territory, which consists of: - core census block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile and - surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile In addition, under certain conditions, less densely settled territory may be part of each UA or UC. The Census Bureau's classification of rural consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside of UAs and UCs.

"dc_description_s": "A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of an U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The map is scanned at a minimum resolution of 250 dots per inch.DRG's are created by scanning published paper maps on high-resolution scanners. The raster image is georeferenced and fit to the UTM projection. Colors are standardized to remove scanner limitations and artifacts. The average data set size is about 6 megabytes in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) with PackBits compression. DRG's can be easily combined with other digital cartographic products such as digital elevation models (DEM) and digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ).DRG's are stored as rectified TIFF files in geoTIFF format. GeoTIFF is a relatively new TIFF image storage format that incorporates georeferencing information in the header. This allows software, such as ArcView, ARC\/INFO, or EPPL7 to reference the image without an additional header or world file.Within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Core GIS data set the DRG's have been processed to be in compliance with departmental data standards (UTM Extended Zone 15, NAD83 datum) and the map collar information has been removed to facilitate the display of the DRG's in a seamless fashion.These DRG's were clipped and transformed to UTM Zone 15 using EPPL7 Raster GIS.",

These DRG's were clipped and transformed to UTM Zone 15 using EPPL7 Raster GIS.DRGs are a useful backdrop for mapping a variety of features. Colors representing various items in the image (contours, urban areas, vegetation, etc.) can be turned off or highlighted depending on the mapping application. In ArcView this is done by choosing the \"Colormap\" option when editing the DRG theme's legend. A variety of other ArcView tools exist to make working with DRGs easier. Also included:Metadata for the scanned USGS 24k Topograpic Map Series (also known as 24k Digital Raster Graphic). Each scanned map is represented by a polygon in the layer and the map date, photo revision date, and photo interpretation date are found in the corresponding attribute record. This layer facilitates searching for DRGs which were created or revised on or between particular dates. Also useful for ascertaining when a particular map sheet was created.",

Smaller areas were collected with 2 points\/square meter and with 8 points\/square meter: 1. 1.5 points\/square meter covers Morrison, Mille Lacs, Benton, Isanti, Sherburne, Anoka, Meeker, Hennepin, Washington, Carver, Scott, and Goodhue counties. 2. 2 points\/square meter covers the Dakota Block (southern 2\/3 of Dakota County) 3. 8 points\/square meter covers portions of Minneapolis\/St. Paul and the City of Maple Grove See map of block boundaries: ftp:\/\/lidar.dnr.state.mn.us\/documentation\/status\/metro_data_delivery_dates.pdf Data are in the UTM Zone 15 coordinate system, NAD83 NAVD88 Geoid09 meters. The tiling scheme is 16th USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle tiles. The vendor delivered the data to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in several formats: 1. One-meter digital elevation model 2. Edge-of-water breaklines 3. Classified LAS formatted point cloud data DNR staff quality-checked the data and created two additional products: two-foot contours and building outlines. Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office using information supplied by the vendor and by DNR. Dakota County staff have clipped by buffer around this community and also provided additional datasets beyond the named 1-Foot Contours; 1 and 3-meter DEMs and 1 and 3-meter Hillshades.",
