"dc_description_s": "ThisMrSID file was derived from the 2015 raster dataset, which consists of 8-bit,4-band (R, G, B, NIR) color orthoimagery. A digital orthoimage is a rasterimage processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the imagedue to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagerycombines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities ofa map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features bymeans of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates theactual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regularmaps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) andsamples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west toeast with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is storedin industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associatedTIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 fromflying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Eachorthoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with theadjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap).

Orthoimagerycombines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities ofa map.

The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) andsamples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west toeast with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is storedin industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associatedTIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 fromflying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL).

A digital orthoimage is a rasterimage processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the imagedue to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagerycombines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities ofa map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features bymeans of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates theactual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regularmaps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) andsamples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west toeast with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is storedin industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associatedTIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 fromflying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Eachorthoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with theadjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap). This dataset is published inNAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_Michigan_South_FIPS_2111_Feet_Intl_feet.",
