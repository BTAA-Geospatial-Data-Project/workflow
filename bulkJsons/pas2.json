Historic USGS 15 minute topographic maps for Pennsylvania as collected from the MapTech Historical Map Collection at 'http:\/\/historical.maptech.com'. Scanned map images from MapTech were downloaded, assembled, and registered and rectified via Arc\/Info to a custom Albers NAD83 projection. The name of the map file will tell you the 15 minute quadrangle, the two letter abbreviation of the state is mostly in and the year it references. Another key point to remember is that through the decades some of the 15 minute USGS quads have changed names. Some examples include the following groups: (Alburtis-Allentown West-Slatington), (Dingmans Ferry-Wallpack), and (Lehighton-Mauch Chunk). On most average monitors the maps look best at a scale of 1:25,000 to 1:30,000.",

The map has 17 cover classses modified from the Anderson Level II system. Landsat remotely sensed data and additional thematic data bases were used to create the map. A decision-tree classification was used, together with ad hoc algorithms to improve local accuracies. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were acquired for three seasons. The spatial accuracy is nominally 30m, but accuracy increases rapidly at larger minimum mapping units and, as a general rule, the map should not be used below 1ha (100m x 100m) resolution. The map extends beyond the watershed but has not been validated outside the watershed boundary and the intersecting counties.",

This site can be used to help you find the particular 2nd PBBA block where you live or where you make any of your breeding bird observations.

Or, you can type in a street address. Be sure to enter both the address and the associated zip code. When you click 'Refresh Map,' the point or address you entered will be shown as a yellow circle on the map within the Atlas block, which is outlined with green lines and identified with a small number, such as 62B43. The ability to locate 2nd PBBA blocks for a specific lat\/long is very helpful, for example, if you have been hiking or boating through an area covering several Atlas blocks, all the while collecting waypoints to go along with breeding bird sightings that you make.

"dc_description_s": "This point dataset represents an (incomplete) inventory of karst features (herein categorized as sinkholes, surface depressions, surface mines, or cave entrances) that have been cataloged in Pennsylvania by the staff of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey since 1985. County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publicatons. Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set. Karst features change considerablely over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem. Development obliterates much of the evidence for underlying karst features.",

Omernik in 1987 and from refinements of Omernik's framework that were made for other projects. Ecoregions describe areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. Omernik's ecoregions are based on the premise that a hierarchy of ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of both living and nonliving phenomena, such as geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology, that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity. All the characteristics are considered when determining ecoregions, but the relative importance of each characteristic may vary from one ecoregion to another. Level III is the most detailed level available nationally for this system of ecoregions.",

It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants.

Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.

Divisions represent the climates within domains and are differentiated based on precipitation levels and patterns as well as temperature. Divisions are subdivided into provinces, which are differentiated based on vegetation or other natural land covers. The finest level of detail is described by subregions, called sections, which are subdivisions of provinces based on terrain features.

The first stream segment flows from the headwaters to the first tributary. Subsequent segments are tributary to tributary. The final segment flows from the last tributary to the mouth which for purposes of this data layer is defined as the point at which the stream crosses the Pennsylvania boundary. The unique segment identifier is constructed from three concatenated fields. The stream code, downstream river mile, and finally the upstream river mile of the segment boundaries (12345_8.000_ 12.000).

"dc_description_s": "This is a county wide analysis of Berks County waterways to determine riparian buffer values given a 50 ft., 50% canopy coverage requirement. The analysis was done by first overlaying the stream shapefile on the orthophotos. Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added. Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile. The canopy coverage percentage was interpeted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement. At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none). - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream. - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. The threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft. If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines. Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline. In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides. Ponds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis. Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value. Edits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious. The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes. The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines. Stream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value. Ten sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007. Source Data: Streamlines - The streamlines were obtained from the Berks County Planning Commission in draft form for the analysis. 2004 Orthophotos - The orthophotos were provided by the Berks County Planning Commission. The following is the metadata for the orthophotos: 'An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 1-foot pixel resolution. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator 'PA', and the State Plane zone designator 'S'. This dataset consists of 10000' x 10000' uncompressed natural color (24-bit) GeoTIFF files with ESRI world files and MrSid compression format at a pixel resolution of 1'. Digital orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Digital orthophotography is a process which converts aerial photography from an original photo negative to a digital product that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation. The imagery was captured at a negative scale of 1:19200 for the purpose of producing orthophotos.'",

Three classes of forest patches were derived: 1) small, 2) medium, and 3) large. A customized algorithm using object-based image analysis techniques within the eCognition software package was to divide the tree canopy into the forest patch classes based on a combination of a combination of size, edge to perimeter ratio, length, and width. In general, small patches represent individual trees or small rows of trees. Medium patches represent clumps of trees, often in suburban or agricultural settings, that are fragmented and may or may not have a duff layer. Large forest patches consist of forested stands that in most cases will have a duff layer.End users of this layer should note that this forest patch classification is one approach and the dataset should be evaluated so as to understand its capabilities and limitations before using for decision making purposes.",

A customized segmentation algorithm within an object-based image analysis system was used to divide the tree canopy into homogenous polygons based on the spatial and spectral qualities in 2010-2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Each polygon was then assigned to the dominant forest type found in the National Forest Type Dataset.End users of this product should exercise caution when making decisions based on this dataset. The National Forest Type Dataset has known accuracy issues, and these issues are likely compounded when the data were reworked into this higher-resolution product.",

The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

"dc_description_s": "This data set represents Prime Agricultural Soils as defined by the County of Chester. The designation equates to any soil map unit designation as 1 or 2 in the Nonirrigated Capability Class from the SSURGO data base. The SSURGO data set is a digital soil survey and is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was collected by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. The SSURGO data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a full county format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. Sometimes a special soil features layer (point and line features) is included. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The data set has been provided to Chester County Departments and PASDA as an ArcView shapefile by the County of Chester, Department of Computer and Information Services. The theme has been reprojected to PA Stateplane NAD83 from its original datum in accordance with the base map standards of the County of Chester. The County of Chester serves as the secondary organization in providing this shapefile, as compared to its originator and primary organization, the Natural Resources Conservation Service.",

"dc_description_s": "This coverage represents the point locations and data for 1,106 groundwater quality monitoring points sampled under the PA DEP Fixed Station Network (FSN) and Ambient Survey groundwater monitoring program. Sample data were collected from August 1985 to December 1998. Monitoring points were typically homeowner wells, springs, public water supplies, or industrial wells. Locations were chosen to represent regional background conditions within a groundwater basin. Samples were collected by prioritized groundwater basins. Monitoring points represent some of the top 100 priority basins of the 478 groundwater basins. Monitoring points were analyzed for 27 different analytes including pH, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphorus, total organic carbon, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, silica, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, zinc, mercury, and turbidity. Data for alkalinity through silica are in mg\/L, whereas values listed for arsenic through mercury are in ug\/L. Turbidity is in NTUs. PH is a laboratory pH value. Analyte values listed with the coverage are means. Monitoring points have been sampled up to 34 times. Trend analysis results are included for 474 monitoring points by parameter. The Kendall Tau rank correlation test was used to test for trends in ground water quality over time. This test is a nonparametric procedure that is similar to the standard correlation coefficient to assess the presence of a relationship between variables. The Kendall Tau value represents a probability that there is a relationship between two variables. A significance level of .05 was used with the calculated Kendall Tau correlation coefficients. Trend analysis was performed on monitoring points using SAS statistical software.",

Currently, wind, solar and biomass supply 2.3% of our nation's electricity. While these renewable sources currently make up only a small fraction of energy production, renewable energy production is expected to increase by more than 70% between 2006 and 2030. Identifying and using land located in areas with high quality renewable energy resource will be an essential component of developing more electricity from renewable energy sources.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian \/ Alaska Native \/ Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011",

The SpectraPlex process takes multiple bands of original image data and compresses them to 255 cluster units using isodata as a cluster mechanism. The result of the process is an image layer of cluster numbers with an accompanying table of band means by cluster number. Color rendition: the shade set is LANDSCOP Portrayal (landscape directed spectral composite portrayal). Total of the visible bands is blue, total of the infrared bands is green, total of all bands modified to help distinguish conifers is red. The images have been converted to ArcInfo Grid coverages, exported and transferred to compact disk. The original SpectraPlex images are approximately 54 megabytes and extend over the Pennsylvania borders. The images on the Terrabyte Images cd-rom have been clipped to the borders of Pennsylvania and cut by county in Pennsylvania.

The BBS was initiated during 1966 by Chan Robbins and his associates at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center to monitor the populations of all breeding bird species across the continental U.S., Canada, and Alaska. Approximately 2200 skilled observers participate in the survey each year. The BBS has accumulated 30 years of data on the abundance, distribution, and trends for more than 400 species of birds. These data are widely used by researchers, various federal and state agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the general public. Analyses of BBS data by PWRC statisticians have been instrumental in the development of innovative approaches for analyzing trends of wildlife populations.",

It does not preclude all development or agricultural operations, but indicates major areas of natural resources that should be protected or subject to limited disturbance. The Natural Landscape contains the highest concentrations of important natural resources. Appropriate low intensity land uses may develop with special precautions to address natural constraints. Conservation practices will be used to protect and restore the natural resources. The significance of the natural landscape in maintaining biodiversity of species, water recharge areas, and preserving a network of natural resources and habitats will be fully recognized and supported by both citizens and government agencies.",

"dc_description_s": "The land surface of Pennsylvania is anything but flat and horizontal. The surface comprises complex arrangements of differences in elevation above mean sea level. The spatial arrangement of these elevation differences comprises topography. Topography that has describable uniformity throughout some areal dimension is termed a landform. Landforms can be classified, boundaries can be drawn, and a map can be created. A preliminary landform map was compiled at approximately 1:605,500 scale. The map has four levels of landform subdivision: province, section, region, and district. These units range in size from many hundreds of square miles (province) to less than 200 square miles (district). The greatest topographic similarity for a given landform unit occurs in the smallest subdivision (district). The greatest topographic dissimilarity for a given landform unit occurs in the largest subdivision (province). The landform map was digitized using ARC\/INFO software. Polygon attributes include name of physiographic province, section, district, and area, and the numerical designation of the landform unit. Arcs were attributed according to whether they form the boundary of one or more of the following: province, section, region, district, or state. These data sets are preliminary and will be superseded in 1999 by more detailed data sets prepared from 1:50,000-scale compilation maps having five levels of landform subdivision.",

"dc_description_s": "The following data set contains all the Oil & Gas Wells in Pennsylvania that the Dept of Enviromental Protection has locational information on. The wells are broken into two formation types of conventional and unconventional wells. A conventional well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of oil or natureal gas from only conventional formation(s). A conventional formation is any formation that does not meet the statutory definition of an unconventional formation. An unconventional gas well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of natural gas from an unconventional formation. Unconventional formation is a geological shale formation existing below the base of the Elk Sandstone or its geologic equivalent stratigraphic interval where natural gas generally cannot be produced at economic flow rates or in economic volumes except by vertical or horizontal well bores stimulated by hydraulic fracture treatments or by using multilateral well bores or other techniques to expose more of the formation to the well bore. The following fields are displayed in the data set: PERMIT_NUM is the Permit Number associated with the well, WELL_NAME is the name given to the well by DEP or the Operator, OPERATOR the name of the current operator for the well, OPER_NUM is the Operator Number associated with the current operator, WELL_TYPE describes the type of well, WELL_TYPECD is the code associated with the Well type, WELL_STAT is the current status of the well, WELL_STATCD is the code associated with the current well status, PERM_DATE is the date associated with the permit number, SPUD_DATE is the drilling commencement date, or proposed drilling commencement date as reported by the operator, CONSV_IND indicates whether thie wellbore penetrates the Onondaga horizon as defined in the PA Oil & Gas Conservation Law, COUNTY is the county the well is permitted in, COUNTY_ID is the code associated to the county, MCD is the municipality that the well is in, MCD_TYPE is the type of municipality that the well is in, MCD_CD is the code associated to the municipality name, LATITUDE is the latitude of the well bore hole, LONGITUDE is the longitude of the well bore hole, PRMRY_FID is a system generated id associated with the primary facility record for this well in the DEP eFACTS database, UNCV_IND indicates whether this is a conventional or unconventional well, SURFACE_ELEV is the ground elevation at the well head location, WELL_CONFIG_CD indicates the well configuration, COAL_IND indicates if the well is in a coal or non coal region, PLUG_C_DATE is the well plug completion date, WELL_PAD is the name of the well pad on which the well is located.",

"dc_description_s": "The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting\\r\\ndata used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance\\r\\nflood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM\\r\\nDatabase is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps\\r\\n(FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data,\\r\\nwhere available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\\r\\nThe file is georeferenced to earth\\s surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system.The\\r\\nspecifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for\\r\\nmapping at a scale of 1:12,000.",

The long-term goals of the EBTJV are to develop a comprehensive restoration and education strategy to improve aquatic habitat, to raise education awareness, and to raise federal, state and local funds for brook trout conservation. In 2005, in recognition of the need to address regional and range-wide threats to brook trout, a group of public and private entities formed the EBTJV to halt the decline of brook trout and restore fishable populations. The group spearheaded a range-wide assessment of brook trout populations and threats to brook trout and brook trout habitat in the Eastern United States (report forthcoming). Seventeen states are currently drafting strategies to prioritize policy changes and on-the-ground actions to improve water quality and restore brook trout habitat and populations in their individual state using locally-driven, incentive-based, and non-regulatory programs.",

The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam. Includes, but is not limited to, strip, auger, quarry, dredging, and leaching mines.",

The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat\/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns. Continuous Emission Monitoring Point: Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.",

"dc_description_s": "Protected areas are cornerstones of national and international conservation strategies. By way of these designations, lands and waters are set-aside in-perpetuity to preserve functioning natural ecosystems, act as refuges for species, and maintain ecological processes. Complementary conservation strategies preserve land for the sustainable use of natural resources, or for the protection of significant geologic and cultural features or open space. PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) attempts to include all available spatial data on these places. It is our goal to publish the most comprehensive geospatial data set of U. S. protected areas to date. PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) is limited to the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. It does not include protected areas data for U.S. territories at this time. The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) data set portrays the nation's protected areas with a standardized spatial geometry and numerous valuable attributes on land ownership, management designations, and conservation status (using national GAP and international IUCN coding systems). The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) defines protected area to include all lands dedicated to the preservation of biology diversity and to other natural, recreation and cultural uses, and managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means (adapted from IUCN definition). The database represents the full range of conservation designations that preserve these natural resources in the United States. Our database does not distinguish a protection threshold above which biodiversity is considered secure. Instead, a complete suite of protected area attributes are provided for each polygon with the purpose of giving users the information they need to define the most relevant conservation thresholds for their own objectives and requirements. Collaborating with the nation's leading data providers, the goal is to provide an annual update.",

"dc_description_s": "Part of the Pennsylvania Gap Analysis Project the Breeding Bird Atlas database indicates bird species and nesting behavior of known birds species in Pennsylvania. The database is organized into two primary segments; the block and the species lists (data). Blocks are defined by a code for the USGS topographic map, and the block number. All records are organized by the Atlas region. Various attributes of the Atlas block are incorporated, including geographic features (physiographic locations), effort (hours of fieldwork). The species segment, being replicated the full 320,000 times, was kept to a minimal size, and lists only the species and breeding code, the year and comment. Evidence of birds nesting within an Atlas block was recorded with a set of codes that describe behavior and physical evidence of nesting. These codes are divided into four hierarchical categories, three of which indicate breeding. 'Observed,' 'Possible,' 'Probable,' and 'Confirmed' breeding codes represent increasing evidence that nesting occurred within the block a species was recorded. 'Probable' and 'Confirmed' categories were further segregated into hierarchical codes that represent individual breeding behaviors or physical evidence of nesting. A description of breeding codes may be provided upon request. All of Pennsylvania's 4,928 atlas 'blocks' were surveyed, with an average of 65 species per block recorded. A total of 188 breeding species were documented statewide. Data catalogued geographically by atlas 'block,' USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, county, and physiographic province. Species files include political status designation and a number of life-history characteristics.",

This GIS Dataset is a representation of the Landscapes identified in the plan. The concept of livable landscapes provides a framework for protection and growth strategies within Chester County. The map provides a guide for accommodating expected future growth while maintaining the quality of life in the county. The Livable Landscapes map is divided into two core areas, growth areas and rural resource areas, as prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The growth areas consist of the urban landscape and the suburban landscape. The rural resource areas consist of the agricultural landscape and the rural landscape. The natural landscape exists throughout the county recognizing the important network of natural resources needing specific protection. Livable landscapes recognizes the diversity that makes Chester County a special place. Each landscape has a different character and is appropriate for different intensities and varieties of development. The urban and suburban landscapes can best accommodate future growth. The county will encourage future development to be concentrated in these landscapes. The rural and agricultural landscapes are least appropriate for intense growth. The county will not encourage development in these landscapes. Livable landscapes is not a land use map. Any land use can be found in each of the landscapes, but the mix and intensity of land uses will be different to preserve the character of each landscape.",

"dc_description_s": "NWI digital data files are records of wetlands location and classification as developed by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps. See section on 'Completeness_Report' for more information.

"dc_description_s": "Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic\/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc\/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work. A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries.

Purpose:INTENDED USE OF DATA; Created to do permit reviews for Water Obstruction and Encroachment Applications. LIMITATIONS OF DATA; Due to the nature of transferring the floodplains from the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps to plotted 1:24000 scale maps this coverage should be considered to be the 'best representation' of the data but not as accurate as, for example, a map of Global Positioning System's floodplain coordinates",

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: These files are estimates of damages and locations generated by the FEMA HAZUS flood analysis model.

The economic loss layer shows total losses in thousands of dollars. The damaged homes layer shows the number of flood-affected residential structures. Additional information for each layer is contained in its attribute table which can be viewed and edited in ArcMap. The display can also be modified or enhanced by changing the layer\\s properties in ArcMap (change the display to classified and the number of classes to 10, for example).",

"dc_description_s": "In 1859, the United States first commercial oil well was drilled in Venango County, Pennsylvania. In the 150 years subsequent to this, an unknown number of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the state. A current estimate by the Independent Petroleum Association of America places that number at approximately 325,000. Of those 325,000 wells, over 200,000 are still unaccounted for. As these wells are found and verified, they are cataloged in the Department of Environmental Protections (DEP) Abandoned and Orphan Well database to facilitate plugging. There are currently over 8,200 wells listed in this database (2013). With so many unknown oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania and the environmental threats that they pose, identification remains a vital component of DEPs Oil and Gas Program. Currently, the DEP, Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and geo-referencing. These maps, which vary in age, not only contain information on historic mine locations, but also oil and gas locations. Through collaboration between the Bureau of Mining Programs and the Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, potential oil and gas well locations were assembled using three mine map collections. These collections include the WPA mine map collection, KSheets collection, and the HSheets collection. From these sources, over 30,000 potential historic oil and gas well locations were derived. The Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management is constantly looking for historic sources to help locate oil and gas wells in the state that remain unaccounted for. This particular dataset was created using georeferenced mine maps of various\/unknown accuracy and various\/unknown coordinate systems to various base maps, including but not limited to USGS topographic maps and PAMAP aerial photography. The locations were then digitized using the georeferenced mine maps. These locations are provided for informational purposes only and should not be sole means of decision making and are in no way a substitute for actual field observations.",

The hubs and corridors are the major concentration of the map and serve as the core conservation areas in the PA Highlands Greenway. The hub and spoke system was created by AMC by combining the results of two analysis techniques, stronghold analysis and the Natural Lands Trusts Smart ConservationTM.. Stronghold analysis identifies areas that are least affected by man-made disturbances such as roads and fragmentation of the natural landscape while Smart Conservation determines the ecological health of an area. The combination of these two analyses in conjunction with the knowledge of local stakeholders was used to prioritize core conservation areas.",

Montgomery County Planning Commission provided in-kind funding for the project as well as completing the assessment portion in Montgomery Count. Heritage Conservancy completed the assessment for the areas in Bucks County and Philadelphia County. Both organizations then mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. The 1' pixel resolution 2010 aerials from DVRPC served as the basis for the riparian conditions along the waterways. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). This dataset is an assessment of the same area completed back in 200-2004. The same methodology of creating 50 foot buffers from the edge of water to assess the tree cover in this area was used. The stream centerline is used to represent the classification of whether one side, both sides, or neither side has tree cover. In addition to the three categories from the previous assessment, the category of culvert was added to incorporate areas where there was not an opportunity for tree cover.",

The conservancy then assessed various watersheds in southeastern Pennsylvania and mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. Interpretation of 1' = 400' black-and-white high altitude aerial photographs, Orthophotos, and videotape from helicopter over flights were used to determine the presence or absence of a forested buffer for 1,200 miles of stream. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). A series of large-scale (1' = 400') maps were produced showing sections of stream bank lacking forest buffers. Local conservation groups were given the maps to assist them in targeting areas for riparian buffer plantings to improve water quality.",
