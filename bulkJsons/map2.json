"dc_description_s": "Since the publication of the Glacial map of Ohio (Goldthwait, White, and Forsyth, 1961, U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Geologic Investigations Map I-316), many workers have continued efforts to decipher the Quaternary history, geomorphology, and deposits of Ohio. This map of the Quaternary geology of Ohio attempts to consolidate this improved understanding of Quaternary geology in a uniform format for the entire state.Compilation ws begun by the late Dr. Richard P. Goldthwait, to whom this map is dedicated. Additional revisions and compilation of a series of 1:250,000-scale open-file maps (Ohio Division of Geological Survey Open-File Maps 291-300, 1993) were completed by staff of the Ohio Geological Survey, prior to preparation of this map. The individual maps used to compile this map differ widely in age, scope, and detail. Many areas of complex geology have been simplified to fit the scale and map units of this map. Refer to the data sources listed below for available maps that have more detail at a larger scale. The geological units on this map are grouped by age, depositional process, (water-deposited, ice-deposited, etc.), and geomorphic occurance (ground moraine, end moraine, hummocky moraine, etc.). For example, the most common unit in northeastern Ohio is G4, a Late Wisconsinan-age clayey till (Hiram Till) depositied as ground moraine.",

"dc_title_s": "Oil and Gas Fields of Ohio: Ohio",
"dc_description_s": "These maps and database are an update of the Ohio Division of Geological Survey (ODGS) oil and gas fields Digital Chart and Map Series (DCMS 13 through 21), which was completed in 1996. Previous Ohio oil and gas fields maps were also published in 1948, 1953, 1960, 1964, and 1974. The updated maps and database have been created using the GIS-based ESRI\/ARCMAP software. All documented oil and gas pools\/fields have been digitized as polygons and each polygon is linked to a unique pool\/field identification (ID) number and name. Like the previous DCMS oil and gas fields maps, the updated oil and gas pools\/fields have been grouped into 8 major plays defined by specific stratigraphic intervals. These are the 1) Pennsylvanian undifferentiated sandstones and coals, 2) Mississippian undifferentiated sandstones (excluding the Berea and Cussewago Sandstone) and Maxville Limestone, 3) Mississippian Berea and Cussewago sandstones), 4) Upper Devonian Ohio Shale and siltstones, 5) Silurian\/Devonian Big Lime interval (Onondaga Limestone, Oriskany Sandstone, Bass Islands Dolomite, Salina Group, and Lockport Dolomite), 6) Silurian Cataract\/ Medina sandstone (Clinton\/Medina) and Dayton Formation (Packer Shell), 7) Middle Ordovician fractured shale, Trenton Limestone and Black River Group and Wells Creek Formation, and 8) Cambrian-Ordovician Knox Dolomite (Beekmantown dolomite, Rose Run sandstone, Copper Ridge dolomite, B-zone, and Krysik sandstone). All oil and gas pool\/field ID's are defined and grouped by play and not geographic boundary, since most of the producing oil and gas reservoirs in Ohio occur within stratigraphic traps. This is a departure from the method used in the 1974 map in which oil and gas fields were assigned geographically, and not by producing horizon. Thus on the 1974 map, one field could contain multiple, stacked, partially overlapping, producing horizons from the Cambrian to the Pennsylvanian. Since the 1974 map was produced, over 58,000 additional wells have been drilled and completed in multiple, stacked producing horizons, mostly in unique stratigraphic traps. This has made it too cumbersome to assign all producing horizons to the same pool\/field ID within any given geographic area. Assignment of pool\/field ID's by play or stratigraphic interval provides a better geologic method of displaying and defining these pools\/fields that are dominantly stratigraphic traps. With this method of outlining polygons for producing horizons, a pool is defined as a single polygon that produces from horizons within one play. When more than one polygon is assigned the same ID within the same play, these polygons are defined as a field. Pool\/field production types are displayed as gas (red), oil (green), or storage (orange). In most cases, the assignment of production type was determined from the 1974 Ohio oil and gas field map. For updates to the 1974 map, the production type (excluding the Knox Dolomite play) was determined by the dominance of oil or gas symbol as displayed on the township well spot maps. In many cases a subjective decision was made, since many of the wells are displayed as combination oil and gas. With the Knox Dolomite play, the production type was based on gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) using data from the ODGS production database POGO (Production of Oil and Gas in Ohio). Oil production is shown for pools\/fields with a GOR less than 5,000, and gas for fields with a GOR greater than 5,000. Calculations are based on cumulative production since 1984. This method of using GOR was not possible for the other, older historical plays because of insufficient production data. Whenever possible, existing outlines from the 1996 digital oil and gas fields maps were used. Exceptions to this are in areas where the 1996-pool\/field boundaries were modified or new pool\/field boundaries were created from additional drilling. Pool\/field boundaries were digitized based upon documented wells from the ODGS township well spot maps, and in some areas from the Ohio Fuel Gas (OFG) well spot maps. The OFG maps were used primarily for the Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays because many of these older wells are not located on the ODGS township well spot maps. In some areas, digitized pools\/fields from the 1996 version were deleted if the oil and gas township and\/or the OFG maps or well cards could not verify them. A minimum of 3 producing wells within a 1-mile distance was required to draw a pool\/field outline. Storage field outlines are approximate and are based primarily on the 1974 map. In drawing new polygons for pool\/field boundaries, a buffer of 1\/2 mile was made around each producing well, and boundaries were drawn using these buffers. In assigning pool\/field ID's, the historical numbers and names from the 1974 map were maintained whenever possible. Pools\/fields may be consolidated into a larger consolidated field only if they occur within the same play. When two or more pools\/fields are consolidated, they were assigned a new field ID. The name of the consolidated field was taken from the oldest pool\/field within the consolidated field. There may be exceptions to this if the name is firmly entrenched in literature (i.e., Canton Consolidated, East Canton Consolidated, etc.). In a given geographic area of multiple producing horizons, the same ID was maintained for the dominant producing horizon. The less dominant producing horizons in other plays for this geographic area were assigned new pool\/field ID's. Every pool\/field with an assigned number has also been assigned a unique name. If it is a new pool\/field ID that was not on the 1974 map, a new name was assigned using the nearest place name (i.e., town, village, city, etc.) or a named geographic feature (i.e., stream, river, ridge, etc.) from a topographic map.",

"dc_description_s": "This polygon feature class represents the spatial extent of surficial geology deposits, glacial and sub-glacial drainage, and historical glacial lake shoreline areas in Oakland County. These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. The key attribute is the geologic sediment type.The primary business purpose for the development of this data set was to collaborate with the Cranbrook Institute of Science in producing an educational map about the surficial geology of Oakland County at a scale appropriate to Countywide and sub-County applications. Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972.

Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. Zawiskie QC'd the data through visual inspections of plots, and Nina Misuraca instituted the corrections.",

Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2015 version of land use was created using the 2014 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels. The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset. Assumptions: In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update. Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park. The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification. The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park. The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use.

Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2012. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2012 version of land use was created using the 2011 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels. The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions: In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update. Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park. The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification. The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park. The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW. Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions. Exceptions: There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel vacant. These parcels are listed below: 01-29-451-001 01-35-300-014 04-08-200-002 04-24-100-004 07-13-301-006 14-04-376-002 18-19-476-015 21-10-200-001 21-10-200-002",

Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2008. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2008 version of land use was created using the 2007 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for the 2007 update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office.

Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.

"dc_description_s": "The primary purpose of this data is to be used by Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services, other County departments, and and local communities for planning purposes.  The two major uses are cartographic output and creating summaries at various spatial extents.The intent of this feature class was to provide a very general representation of a hard copy 1966 land use map.  The spatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature was limited by the intended purpose of the data.The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land use map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater than 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire county was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on the Landuse.Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the following process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was modifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were buffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from RoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two types (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent property was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County Register of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in liber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that simultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in 1966.  Major roads that intersected or were adjacent with these simultaneous conveyances were classified as Dedicated and the remainder of Major Roads were classified as a Perscriptive Easement.  The buffer distances, representing half the total Right-of-Way width, used for each road code are listed below:     Minor Road - 30 feet     Major Road (Perscriptive Easement) - 33 feet     Major Road (Dedicated) - 46.5 feet     State Highway - 46.5 feetU.S. Highway - 46.5 feet     Interstate - 60 feet feetThese Right-of-Way widths generally approximate those that actually existed in 1966 and are not intended to indicate the exact width of a specific Right-of-Way.  All areas completely surrounded by Right-of-Way such as between directions of travel of a boulevard or interstate or the area inside of a freeway interchange were manually attributed as Right-of-Way.Water features were burned in the final feature class using a modified version the of the Oakland County Waterbody feature class.  This data was modified to reflect waterbodies in 1966 using the 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.Lastly, the features that intersected community boudaries were split using the Identity tool to increase cartographic and analytic performance.",

"dc_title_s": "OC Development Authority: Oakland County, Michigan",
"dc_description_s": "The DevelopmentAuthority polygon feature class identifies certain types of entities that encourage development\/redevelopment in designated areas. This feature class currently represents Downtown Development Authorities (DDA), Tax Increment Finance Authorities (TIFA), and Local Development Finance Authorities (LDFA); however, it will also depict Corridor Improvement Authorities (CIA) and Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (BRA) in the future. These five types of authorities have the ability to capture tax increment financing (TIF).The features were digitized using legal descriptions, parcel lists, and maps that were provided to the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal and\/or Oakland County Equalization by the authority. The key attributes are Name (official name of the authority), Type (the type of development authority), and DevelopmentPlan (yes\/no indicating if the feature represents an area that is part of a development plan and can caputre tax increment financing).Tax Increment Financing is a tool used to promote redevelopment and community improvement projects by channeling funding toward projects in targeted areas. TIF is captured from the increase of property values from a base year. Millage rates from taxing jurisdictions are applied to the increased value. The resulting tax revenue is directed to the authority, rather than the appropriate jurisdiction.Beginning in 1994, taxing jurisdictions have the option to opt out of having its taxes captured by the authority. Also since 1994, school taxes may no longer be captured unless they are necessary to make payments on existing eligible obligations. For more information about TIF, see Michigan Department of Treasury's Tax Increment Financing FAQ web page at http:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/treasury\/0,1607,7-121-3218---F,00.html. The State of Michigan has adopted enabling legislation to allow TIF through five types of authorities. Each type of authority has a focus relating to development\/redevelopment: Downtown Development Authority (PA 197 of 1975)'Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districts Tax Increment Finance Authority (PA 450 of 1980)Prevent urban deteriorationEncourage economic development and activityEncourage neighborhood revitalization and historic preservationClosed to new applicants since 1987Allows the development of virtually any type of land use Local Development Finance Authority (PA 281 of 1986)Encourage local developmentPromote conditions of employmentPromote economic growthLimited to business activities involving:ManufacturingAgricultural processingHigh-technology activitiesEnergy productionBusiness incubators Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (PA 381 of 1996)Promote revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain propertyFocus on tax reverted, blighted, or functionally obsolete propertyMDEQ must approve brownfield redevelopment areas Corridor Improvement Authority (PA 281 of 2005)Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districtsMust be adjacent to a road classified as an arterial or collectorThese quasi-public entities are created by resolution through a community's governing body. CIA and LDFA boundaries may cross municipal boundaries. In the case of these multi-jurisdictional authorities, both communities must pass resolutions establishing authority. There is currently only one Joint LDFA (Cities of Southfield and Troy) and there are no CIAs in Oakland County. When the community establishes the authority, it must also define the geographic boundaries in which it will operate. DDAs and CIAs are authorized to levy and collect taxes through a special assessment on all properties within the authority boundary.After the authority and its boundaries are established, the authority creates a tax increment financing and development plan. The plan estimates the amount of tax increment financing that will be captured and lists specific projects on which it will be spent. It also defines the development area where the tax increment financing and projects will occur. The development area must be completely within the authority boundary; however, it may be coincident with the authority boundary.An authority may contain multiple development areas, each with its own development and tax increment financing plan. BRAs normally designate development areas as a one or two parcels for a specific development project, while the other types of authorities define development areas as a larger area. Also, LDFAs are only allowed to capture TIF from parcels in a permitted use, such as manufacturing.There may be both eliglible and inelgible parcels within a development area; however, the inelgible parcels do not participate in TIF capture. The base year used to calculate the amount of tax increment financing is set when the development plan is adopted. If the development plan is expanded at a later date, the base year could be reset for the entire development area or the capture could be calculated using multiple base years.The source for the base year was the tax billing code used by Oakland County Equalization. When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford'Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and\/or map.For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.The data will be updated on an as needed basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments. In particular, county departments may not be aware of BRA development projects when no TIF is captured. Lastly, because the tax parcel feature class is revised periodically and it is important for the features to be coincident with the tax parcel feature class, the development authority feature class will also be updated annually to correct conflicts due to parcel shifting.",

In the Recorded Document Profile search within Land Access, three separate searches were performed to identify state recorded conservation easements: - State of Mi was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Michigan Dep was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Department was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. The legal description was used to identify the general location of the easement.Most often, these easements are created within a new residential development and may contain multiple conservation areas. In these cases, the point was placed in a general location within the subdivision to represent all the areas described in the conservation easement. The attribute information (i.e., GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page) was also collected through Land Access.Once complete, the dataset was verified internally and checked against information obtained from the Michigan Department of Environment Quality. We contacted David R. Dortman from the Land and Water Management Division who provided a list of the easements the state had record of. The list contained the Grantor, Liber, Page, and Acreage.",

For example, one community may have two commercial districts- Local Commerical and General Commercial. Another community may have three commercial districts- Neighborhood Commercial, Hi-Tech Office, and Retail Commercial. A wide range of uses could be included in these categories, but for the purpose of this feature class, they are all translated into Commercial\/Office. In some cases a category on community's future land use map could not be translated into a single composite category. When this occurred, areas were manually translated into the appropriate generalized category. For example, a Public Lands class on a community's map would be manually translated into the Public\/Institutional and Recreation\/Conservation composite categories.",

The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the 2004 Oakland County Natural Areas Report update. Each feature was assigned a priority of One, Two, or Three. Digital Landcover, orthophotography, and USGS quadrangle maps were the main sources used to identify each natural area. The data from the Oakland County Natural Areas update project was collected in 2004. Key attributes include Priority and TotalScore. Priority is a reflection of quality and indicates the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state of the identified area.The NaturalArea2004 data should be distributed with the Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004. This document provides essential information for the attributes and procedures used to create the features in the dataset.

Rasegan, RA, Charlotte P. Burckhardt, AICP, PCP, Lawrence S. Falardeau, RLA, Russell Lewis, RA, Leslie E. Kettren, AICP, Jim Keglovitz, and JoAnn Browning The Shiawassee and Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project involved six communities (Highland, Milford, Rose, Springfield, and White Lake Townships, and the Village of Milford) in western Oakland County. A Steering Committee composed of local officials, developers, property owners, and land conservancy members was the policy group that directed the project. The Steering Committee contracted with the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) to identify potentially significant natural areas. Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - July 2002 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Michael Penskar, Program Leader - Botany Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Michigan Natural Features Inventory P.O. Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 This report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in Oakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the landscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of potential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural features. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological services such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil development and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel corridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic diversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological value of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas can also be used to update and track the status of these remaining sites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local municipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize conservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. In this report the term potential natural area has been used in place of the term potential conservation area. The substitution was made in order to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites that are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better understanding of the term natural area. The term potential natural area, however, is not to be confused with the legal term dedicated Natural Area as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which gives land special legal protection.When using this information it is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a starting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, each community, group or individual using this information should determine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. Materials and Interpretation Methodology: Interpretation of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using digital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's Planning and Economic Development Services Division. As the townships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this imagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for Geographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b), and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These additional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the interpretation process. Delineation of sites was done through aerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) wetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested tracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done conservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up being eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of omitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated by focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much development (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as possible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads, parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural areas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal boundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the boundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all sites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. Following the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential natural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each site could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total calculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.",

For example, the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) traffic control officers who prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation. The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 40 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, where are the majority of Unsafe Operator moving violations in the AM Rush of 2014 These data will give up to 52 distinct street segments of information one for each week of the year.Field Definitions:Identification Weeknumber Week of Year, based on a Sunday start of the week StreetSeg Street Segment ID, corresponds to the DDOT street centerline StreetSegID field Registered Name Street nameStreetType Type of Street (Road, Ave, etc)Quad DC Quadrant FromAddLeft Unit number start (for approximating this segment s block) ToAddLeft Unit number end (for approximating this segment s blockMovingLow Speeding (Under 20mph) - speed violations under 20mphHigh Speeding (above 20mph) - speed violations over 20 mph including reckless drivingUnsafe Driving -violations for driving maneuvers unsafe to traffic Unsafe Vehicle - violations for vehicle characteristics unsafe to traffic Unsafe Operator- violations for operator (driver) characteristics unsafe to trafficOther- miscellaneous violationsImportant Notes: Records which could not be associated to a street centerline segment (StreetSeg) were excluded from these summariesRecords which do not have a time of day associated with the violation were excluded from these summaries.",

Nursing homes were queried from the master table based on state licensed nursing home beds (NH_BEDS) and boarding care beds (BCH_BEDS). This includes nursing facility and boarding care beds that fall under Federal MEDICAID. Once the nursing home records were isolated, address records were cleaned for geocoding. Geocoding was performed by the Hennepin County GIS Office using composite locators. Addresses found within the metropolitan area will have a higher degree of accuracy than those throughout Minnesota. Original data was downloaded from: http:\/\/www.health.state.mn.us\/divs\/fpc\/directory\/fpcdir.html and included the following statement: Health Care Facility and Provider Database: This database offers addresses, phone numbers, administrator names and state registration or licensure status for Minnesota health care providers. Federal certification classifications are also included. Provider types in the directory are boarding care homes, home health agencies, home care providers, hospices, hospitals, housing with services, nursing homes and supervised living facilities and other non-long term care providers. Providers can be selected by type, county, city or name. The NAME field is the name for each nursing home.

Data was extracted from the Minnesota Department of Health Health Care Facility and Provider Database on February 22, 2016. Please note that licensing and status of hospitals can change; refer to the Minnesota Department of Health webpage for current status. Addresses were cleaned and geocoded by the Hennepin County Human Services and Public Health Dept (HSPHD) & the Hennepin County GIS Office. Where possible road centerline geocoded locations were improved to parcel centroid or building footprint. Additional modifications were performed by the Hennepin County GIS Office including the following: Retention of the VA Hospital from previous geocoded versions. Break out of the U of M East Bank, West Bank, and Masonic Childrens Hospitals. Break out of the Rochester Mayo campuses. Addition of Health System information supplied by HCMC staff.

The seven counties are assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The field PIN is the parcel ID for each parcel address. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate\/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. The point layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel, and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores, or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many but not all counties. The seven-county dataset is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. (See http:\/\/www.metrogis.org\/how-do-i-get\/parcel-data.aspx for more information.) Each of the seven Metro Area counties has entered into a multiparty agreement with the Metropolitan Council to assemble and distribute the parcel data for each county as a regional (seven county) parcel dataset.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis.

Each geographic region will have one hub site in which all core HSPHD services will be provided or accessed, and one or more satellite sites at which specialized services will be provided. Regionalization (or decentralization) of services, along with a redesigned (and integrated) client service delivery model, will provide for easier client access to services and information, along with better client outcomes.The boundary was updated March 2014 to align with the county boundary, municipal boundaries, Minneapolis neighborhoods, and Franklin Ave. This was completed by the Hennepin County GIS Office.

This dataset includes those locations primarily engaged in forest or grasslands fire fighting, including fire lookout towers if the towers are in current use for fire protection purposes. This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire fighting training academies are also included. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes. Records with '-DOD' appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record dates from 01\/05\/2005 and the newest record dates from 08\/07\/2008.

The roadway segments break at every street, alley, service road and ramp. This is the roadway segment ID at the crash location.MARID - For crashes that cannot be located using the MPD-supplied latitude\/longitude coordinates, DDOT attempts to locate the crash using the MPD-supplied nearest address. The address is processed against OCTO's Master Address Repository Web services to find the address latitude\/longitude coordinatesADDRESS - The MPD-supplied address associated to the crash. It's assumed that this is the nearest address to the crash location.WARD - DC Ward of the address location, which is supplied by the MAR.EVENTID - DDOT's internally managed LRS ID for the crash locationMAJORINJURIES* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverMINORINJURIES* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverFATAL* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverIMPAIRED* - Total number impaired persons involvedTOTAL_TAXIS - Total number of taxis involved in the crash. NOTE: this does not include car-sharing vehicles such as Lyft or Uber.TOTAL_GOVERNMENT - Total number of DC, federal or other governmental vehicles involved in the crash.SPEEDING_INVOLVED - Indicates if the reporting officer believed speeding was a factor in the crash. NOTE: this doesn't necessarily equate to participants being ticketed\/cited for speeding.Questions on the contents of these layers should be emailed to Metropolitan Police Department or the DDOT Traffic Safety Division.

It also contains polygons representing the locations of multiple tax properties (multi-PID parcels). It is the combination of the parcel base dataset and the multiple parcel base dataset with attributes from a monthly extract of the property tax information system. The PID field contains the property ID number for each parcel. In the case of multiple tax properties, several parcel polygons may be stacked on top of one another. These are multiple tax parcels that cannot be delineated on a two-dimensional map, including both taxed and tax-exempt parcels. The parcels are represented with identical geometries but have different parcel IDs and associated tax attributes.

"dc_title_s": "Base Flow of Michigan Streams: Michigan",
"dc_description_s": "This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",
