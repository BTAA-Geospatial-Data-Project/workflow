"dc_title_s": "Northern Lancaster County Groundwater Study: Pennsylvania",
"dc_description_s": "Contains various shapefiles, pdf's, and jpeg maps pertaining to the Northern Lancaster County Groungwater study. Layer inculde groundwater basin shapefiles include - river basins, MCD's, census blocks, sewage treament outfalls, water use, study area, dry stream valley systems, geology, karst modified uplands, impervious surfaces, wetlands. JPEG maps include study area, basins, withdraws, conductivity, nitrates, geology, water tables, flowlines, mapplate. Achieving a balance among environmental, human, and economic needs in the management of the basin?s water resources is a critical mission of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (Commission), as described in the 1971 Susquehanna River Basin Compact (Compact). The Commission carries out its water resource management responsibilities in a number of ways through its regulatory program, public education and information, and resource evaluation. In areas of intense water resource utilization, the Commission may conduct special studies, water budget analyses, and identify critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs). The Commission, in partnership with the Lancaster County Conservation District (LCCD), performed a groundwater resources evaluation of a carbonate valley located in northern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The project was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) through its Growing Greener Grant Program. The study area includes an isolated carbonate aquifer of 50 square miles and a surrounding siliciclastic contributing area of 20 square miles. Parts of 13 municipalities, including the Boroughs of Manheim, Lititz, Akron, Ephrata, and Denver, are located in the study area. Groundwater is the primary source of water for municipal, domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. As groundwater withdrawals increase to meet growing demands, stakeholders need information on the location and quantity of water resources available, and how to best develop, conserve, and protect them. Removal of groundwater resources faster than the sustainable rate could lead to a growing water deficit, the gradual failure of water supplies, diminishing stream and spring flows, and degraded aquatic and riparian habitat. Project participants involved the local public during the course of the study through a Water Budget Advisory Committee (WBAC) and educational workshops. Important resource areas are identified, and management recommendations for these areas are provided in this report. The study area has experienced rapid growth. From 1990 to 2000, several municipalities in the study area exceeded Lancaster County?s growth rate of 11.3 percent. Warwick Township, located in the Manheim?Lititz groundwater basin, experienced the highest growth rate of 33.2 percent. Anticipated growth and development in the study area are expected to result in 2 increased water demand. Population projections from 2000 through 2025 represent a 26 percent increase. Historic changes in land use have led to increased impervious areas, increased stormwater runoff, and reduced infiltration. Impervious cover was 9 percent of the 70-squaremile study area. This potentially reduces average annual recharge by 1,575 million gallons in the study area. When one considers the carbonate areas of the Manheim-Lititz and Ephrata area groundwater basins, 12.6 percent and 8 percent of these areas are impervious, respectively. The focus of the study is a valley approximately 50 square miles in area, underlain by a highly productive carbonate aquifer, and herein informally termed the ?carbonate valley.? The carbonate valley is surrounded almost entirely by hills underlain by aquifers of much lower permeability (Figure 2). The carbonate valley includes parts of the Chiques Creek, Cocalico Creek, and Lititz Run watersheds. Streams generally flow from north to south across the study area, with the exception of the largest stream, Cocalico Creek, which flows from northeast to southwest. The study area includes parts of 8 townships and 5 boroughs, and had a population of approximately 61,000 in the year 2000. Water supply needs are met almost entirely by groundwater. The valley was once largely agricultural, but is rapidly changing to a mosaic of urban, suburban, and agricultural areas. The population in the carbonate valley is rapidly growing, as is the need for water. However, the amount of water available is limited. Most of the groundwater is derived from the carbonate aquifer that underlies the valley. The presence of sinkholes, abundant closed depressions, large springs, and lack of streams in many areas suggests that dissolution of the carbonate bedrock, a condition known as karst, has substantially enhanced the ability of the aquifer to store and transmit water. Karst aquifers are known for their abundant water resources and extremely high well yields, as well as their hard water, enigmatic flow patterns, sinkholes, and high susceptibility to contamination.",

"dc_description_s": "Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts\/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

The sub-facility types related to Municipal Waste Operations that are included are:_Composting: Includes facilites that use land for processing municipal waste by composting. Composting is a process that biologically decomposes organic waste under controlled anaerobic or aerobic conditions to yield a humus-like product. Land Application: Includes facilities that uses agricultural utilization or land reclamation of waste. Sewage sludge is land-applied for its nutrient value or as a soil conditioner. Landfill - Abandoned: The Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project collects geospatial and descriptive data for closed and abandoned landfills throughout the state of Pennsylvania. Locations for sites were determined from historic records such as microfiche, index card, topographic map, and staff personal files, and then compiled into site lists. Each of the six DEP regions is staffed with summer interns who physically locate the sites and collect the data for the project. The purpose of the Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project is to determine the location of abandoned and closed landfills in order to catalog potential environmental hazards. The data is intended for internal government and public consumption, in order to keep property sales, clean-up efforts, and land development well informed. For metadata on the ALI Project, see Abandonded Landfill Metadata. Landfill: A landfill is a facility that uses land for the disposal of municipal waste. Processing Facility: A processing facility is a transfer station, composting facility, resource recovery facility, or a facility that reduces the volume or bulk of municipal waste for offsite reuse. Resource Recovery: A resource recovery is a facility that provides for the extraction and utilization of materials or energy from municipal waste. The facility can be a mechanical extraction facility or a combustion facility. Transfer Station: A transfer station is a facility that receives and processes or temporarily stores municipal waste at a location other than the generation site. This sub-facility facilitates the transportation or transfer of municipal waste to a processing or disposal facility.",

Wetland sites, comprising more than 168,000 polygons, were defined as 1-km radius landscape circles around the center point of each wetland polygon. Landscape composition was summarized by extracting information of a set of patches of the same type (i.e., a NLCD land use class) within each circle. The following NLCD land use classes were studied: (1) water, (2) developed, open space, (3) developed, low intensity, (4) developed, medium intensity, (5) developed, high intensity, (6) barren, rock\/clay\/sand, (7) forest, (8) shrub, scrub, (9) pasture, hay, (10) cultivated crops, and (11) wetlands. In addition, four indicators of human activity -Total Core Area Index, Road Density, Landscape Development Intensity Index, and Impervious Surface- were quantified by integrating land cover and road network information.",

"dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using the PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005 (downloaded from PASDA) and Landscape Blocks as originated by The Nature Conservancy. The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use\/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Grasslands vegetation cover (Pasture\/Grass) from the 2005 land cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of '0' to areas in the Grasslands land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the grasslands vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-25 0 25-100 1 100-150 3 150-200 4 200-600 5 > 600 6 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

Using an inside buffer of 30 meters on the Forest cover (Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, and Woody Wetland) from the 1992 land Cover, the interior forest raster was created. Acreage of the contiguous interior forest was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-25 0 25-50 1 50 - 100 2 100 - 150 3 150 - 225 4 225 - 300 5 300 - 400 6 400 - 500 7 500 - 750 8 750 - 1000 9 >1000 10 No data 0 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the expanded piedmont ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

An orthoimage is a remotely sensed image that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement, and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation.  Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  Source images were captured in natural color at a negative scale of 1:19200.  PAMAP data are organized into blocks, which do not have gaps or overlaps, that represent 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet on the ground. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block\\s northwest corner, the State identifier PA, and the State Plane zone designator N or S (e.g. 45001210PAS).",

"dc_description_s": "The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer. The 2011 CDL has a ground resolution of 30 meters. The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 5 TM sensor, Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, the Spanish DEIMOS-1 sensor, the British UK-DMC 2 sensor, and the Indian Remote Sensing RESOURCESAT-1 (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) collected during the current growing season.Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), the USGS National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter 16 day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites.Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. The NLCD 2006 is used as non-agricultural training and validation data.Please refer to the 'Supplemental_Information' Section of this metadata file for a complete list of all imagery, ancillary data, and training\/validation data used to generate this state's CDL.The strength and emphasis of the CDL is agricultural land cover. Please note that no farmer reported data are derivable from the Cropland Data Layer.",

Two different camera systems were used to obtain simultaneous coverage of black-and-white (BW) and color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs over the conterminous United States. The color-infrared photographs were taken with an 8.25-inch focal length lens and are at a scale of 1:58,000. The black-and-white photographs were taken with a 6-inch focal length lens and are at a scale of 1:80,000. The NHAP program, which was operational from 1980 to 1989, consists of approximately 500,000 images. Photographs were acquired on 9-inch film and centered over USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles. Not Georeferenced. Statewide historic aerial images for Pennsylvania. Color-infrared photographs from the National High Altitude Photography (NHAP) program, conducted by the USGS. Pennsylvaina imagery was captured between 03\/27\/1980 & 05\/13\/1987. The USGS The National High Altitude Photography (NHAP) program, which was operated from 1980-1989, was coordinated by the U.S. Geological Survey as an interagency project to eliminate duplicate photography in various Government programs. The aim of the program was to cover the 48 conterminous states over a 5-year span. In the NHAP program, black-and-white and color-infrared aerial photographs were obtained on 9-inch film from an altitude of 40,000 feet above mean terrain elevation and are centered over USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles. The color-infrared photographs are at a scale of 1:58,000 (1 inch equals about .9 miles). All NHAP flights were flown in a North to South direction. These photographs are offered as digital images (https:\/\/catalog.data.gov\/datasethap-national-high-altitude-aerial-photography-1980-1989 , April 2017). In 2016, Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps & Geospatial Information at The Pennsylvania State University obtained high quality digital images of 9x9 film from USDA - FSA Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO). Digital images were captured at 2,032 dpi with Wehrli and Associates, Inc. RM-6 and RM-3 photogrammetric scanners. The complete collection of 2,607 images contain 60% forward and 30% side to side overlapping coverage for all of Pennsylvania.",

The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 4.8 feet at the 95% confidence level. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator PA, and the State Plane zone designator S.",

The imagery was collected using the Leica Geosystems ADS40-SH51 during Fall, 2010 and Spring, 2011 at an average altitude of 4,800 meters above ground level. An auto correlated elevation model was used as vertical control. Airborne GPS\/IMU was used as a basis for Analytical Aerial Triangulation (AT). Following rectification of imagery, manually placed seamlines were used to mosaic into a seamless coverage. The orthophotography is georeferenced to Geographic NAD83 decimal degrees.",

NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery\\r\\nduring the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S..\\r\\nA primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of\\r\\northo imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides two\\r\\nmain products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho\\r\\nimagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +\/- 3\\r\\nmeters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQs) from\\r\\nthe National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); and, 2 meter GSD\\r\\northo imagery rectified to within +\/- 10 meters of reference\\r\\nDOQQs.  The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75\\r\\nx 3.75 quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four\\r\\nsides.

The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to a consistent datum, edge-match, fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams, recast the data to a consistent geographic projection and convert all elevation values to decimal meters as a consistent unit of measure.NED has a resolution of one-third arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for much of the conterminous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico in a NAD83 datum. There is a resolution of two arc-seconds for Alaska and the datum is NAD27.NED at 10 meters is created using the same methods outlined above with the source data being mostly the 10m DEMs. DEMs at 5 meters, 1\/3 arc-second, and 1\/9 arc-second maps are also used where available. In some cases, the 10m NED is resampled from LIDAR or created using aerial photography.One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. Artifact removal greatly improves the quality of the slope, shaded-relief, and synthetic drainage information that can be derived from the elevation data.  Geospatial elevation data are used by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping, and visualization applications.NRCS has elected to ONLY serve NED 10 which is 10 meter or better and not NED 10 which was resampled from 30 meter. NRCS also serves the maps in a UTM projection. These two facts differentiate the maps from those served at http:\/\/seamless.usgs.gov\/.",

The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county.

"dc_description_s": "Lake Erie Watershed 2012 Lidar Woolpert Project Number: 72835 2012 Lake Erie Drainage Area (Erie, PA) Digital Orthoimagery\/LiDAR Project - In the fall of 2012, Woolpert obtained new aerial LiDAR covering the entire project area (512 square miles). The aerial LiDAR was acquired at a point density average of 1-meter with final products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November). The LiDAR is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500' x 2,500' tiles (which matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Each LiDAR file is approximately 40 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The LiDAR data will be utilized for the rectification of aerial imagery to produce 1=100 scale ortho-imagery with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The LiDAR data will also be used as a component during the future delineation of project area wide impervious surfaces (using remote sensing techniques). FINAL DELIVERABLES: The final deliverables are listed below. The final LiDAR data was delivered in a State Plane projection tiling format, based on a modular layout. The tiles were clipped to eliminate overlap between adjacent tiles. The 2500 feet x 2500 feet tile file name was derived from the lower left coordinates of each tile.  LAS v1.2 classified point cloud NAD83 (NSRS2007) Pennsylvania State Plane North Zone U.S. Feet, NAVD88 GEOID09 U.S. Feet.  Tile data extent provided as ESRI v10.0 shapefile.  Control data provided as ESRI v10.0 shapefile.  FGDC compliant metadata by file in XML format.  LiDAR processing report in pdf format.",

"dc_description_s": "High resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin, an area comprised of parts of six counties in the state of New York and four counties in Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass\/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color\/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.",

"dc_description_s": "Change in the District of Columbias tree canopy estimated from 2011 leaf-on imagery and 2006 leaf-on imagery in conjunction with 2008 leaf-off LiDAR. This layer consists of three classes of tree canopy: 1) no change, 2) loss, and 3) gain. No change indicates that the tree canopy has not changed substantially from 2006 to 2011. Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Extensive quality assurance and quality control methods were employed. This dataset has been independently reviewed by two separate organizations.",

The aerial LiDAR was acquired at a point density average of 1-meter with final products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November). The LiDAR is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500 x 2,500 tiles (which matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Each LiDAR file is approximately 40 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The LiDAR data will be utilized for the rectification of aerial imagery to produce 1 201d=100 2019 scale ortho-imagery with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The LiDAR data will also be used as a component during the future delineation of project area wide impervious surfaces (using remote sensing techniques).",

This data represents the potential flood extent for a stage of 11-ft to 37-ft as recorded at the Harrisburg (Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, PA; USGS ID 01570500) river gage. This data is part of a series of inundation layers meant to correlate observations and forecasts from the river gage with a visual representation of the areas impacted by high water. The data set of flood inundation areas was created from flood scenarios generated by HEC-RAS runs provided by USACE-Baltimore and LiDAR data from PASDA processed to extract bare earth points. A shapefile of inundation area for each stage was created and subsequently merged to form continuous datasets for the main-stem Susquehanna River and backwater areas on its tributaries.This data was developed to assist the public and emergency officials with planning and response to high water episodes at or near a defined National Weather Service river forecast point.",

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection\/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South Zone, US survey feet and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID 12B), US survey feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 129 individual 2,500-foot X 2,500-foot tiles, 1-foot hydro-flattened bare-earth raster DEMs in ERDAS .IMG format and intensity images in GeoTIFF format, tiled to the same 2,500-foot X 2,500-foot tile schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. A mosaic of the hydro-flattened bare-earth raster DEMs was produced in ERDAS .IMG format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, A total of 18 calibration control points in order to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. The accuracy of the data was checked with 20 NVA points and 5 VVA points (25 total QC checkpoints).",

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection\/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South Zone, US survey feet; NAVD1988 (Geoid 12B), US survey feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 711 individual 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot tiles. Tile names use the following naming schema: YYYYXXXXPAd where YYYY is the first 3 characters of the tile\\s upper left corner Y-coordinate, XXXX - the first 4 characters of the tile\\s upper left corner X-coordinate, PA = Pennsylvania, and d = \\N\\ for North or \\S\\ for South. Corresponding 2.5-foot gridded hydro-flattened bare earth raster tiled DEM files and intensity image files were created using the same 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Continuous 2-foot contours were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR collection began in Spring 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 84 control points (24 calibration control points and 60 QC checkpoints). These were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area.",

The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 2.5 pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, 8-bit intensity images, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. To better understand one of the state 2019s most vital natural resources and accurately plan for the future, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), through grant funding provided to the Pennsylvania Sea Grant (PASG) College Program, partnered with Woolpert to acquire imagery and lidar data for the entire Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed and all 77 miles of shoreline. - See more at: http:\/\/www.xyht.com\/aerialuas\/heights-april-2017-mapping-the-pennsylvania-lake-erie-watershed\/#sthash.n3pVphR6.dpuf",

The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 2.5 pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, 8-bit intensity images, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. To better understand one of the state 2019s most vital natural resources and accurately plan for the future, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), through grant funding provided to the Pennsylvania Sea Grant (PASG) College Program, partnered with Woolpert to acquire imagery and lidar data for the entire Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed and all 77 miles of shoreline. - See more at: http:\/\/www.xyht.com\/aerialuas\/heights-april-2017-mapping-the-pennsylvania-lake-erie-watershed\/#sthash.n3pVphR6.dpuf",
