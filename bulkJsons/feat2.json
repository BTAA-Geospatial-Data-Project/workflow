As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U. S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

In exchange, The Maryland Historical Trust promises to protect the property by ensuring continuous compliance with the terms of the Easement. The Trust is also available to advise owners on the correct and best methods of preserving and using their properties.

Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designates Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) for purposes of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. The LIHTC program is defined in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The LIHTC is a tax incentive intended to increase the availability of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC statute provides two criteria for QCT eligibility. A census tract must have either: 1) a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 2) 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income. The area corresponds to a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census. Last Updated: 01\/2017",

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland s Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts. The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland s roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where 0 represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), 1 represents the count taken in 2013, 2 represents the count taken in 2012, 3 represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.

The feature layer supports Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) leadership and planners as they endeavor to mitigate or prevent the infrastructure impacts of sea level change resulting from land surface subsidence and rising sea levels. The product forecasts areas of inundation and represents the new zero elevation for the future scenario. Methodology: US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided the sea level change (SLC) estimate-1. SLC was localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying-2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations were transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land subsidence was applied to create an SLC value for the official project year, 2015. The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified bathtub model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the local minima were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and\/or Chesapeake Bay influence. -1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve. See http:\/\/www. corpsclimate. us\/ccaceslcurves. cfmfor more detail. -2 Closest station with historic records of 40 years or greater.

For this document, the Critical Area is all land and water areas within 1000 feet of the tidal waters' edge or from the landward edge of adjacent tidal wetlands and the lands under them. Georeferenced digital data files of the critical Area have been produced for Baltimore City and the 16 Maryland counties with land located within the Critical Area. The digital maps produced for each jurisdiction are polygons depicting the Critical Area and the land use classifications recognized by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CBCAC). Each jurisdiction is a separate file. The data were produced from hard copy parcel maps originally submitted by the counties as part of the requirements for developing their Critical Area Program. For the purpose of the Mdimap web service the Critical Area Data is displayed by two data layers, one general layer and one layer showing the available critical area data for local towns.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. Each point in Coastal Resiliency Assessment Shoreline Points represents a 250 meter segment of the Maryland coast, including Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay and Coastal Bay shorelines. The Natural Capital Project's Coastal Vulnerability model was used to calculate a Shoreline Hazard Index, representing the relative exposure of each segment to storm-induced erosion and flooding. Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR s Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities. This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS). The statements, finding and recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the U. S. Department of Commerce.

S. Department of the Interior. The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR. Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks, forests, wildlife habitat, natural, scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements, critical maintenance, and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System, which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence, you will see the same acreage, BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project. This file consists of stateside POS projects only.",

Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. The Clean Water Act requires three components to water quality standards that set goals for and protect each States' waters. The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e. g. , recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e. g. , bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26. 08. 02. 04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4. 00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse.

While not a fishery in Maryland, they are a prey species for larger fisheries in the Chesapeake. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists.

Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland s Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts. The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland s roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where 0 represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), 1 represents the count taken in 2013, 2 represents the count taken in 2012, 3 represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

QuesterTangent s SWATHVIEW seabed classification software to post-process the 410 kHz side scan sonar signal. This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes. Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data. REFS: Conkwright, R. D. , Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E. R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

For extent acquracies please contact the project lead for each study. Secondary habitats were delineated using sandy beach data from VIMS and salinity data from Lee Karrh of DNR. Sandy beach areas were selected and exported from the source file and then combined with the salinity data to determine sensitivity importance levels. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county. Last Updated: 04\/10\/2012",

QuesterTangent s SWATHVIEW seabed classification software was used to post-process the 410 kHz side scan sonar signal. This software analyzes the side scan sonar backscatter signal to produce a classification map based on the acoustical reflectivity characteristics of bottom sediments. Employing proprietary algorithms SWATHVIEW uses multivariate analysis to find patterns in the side scan acoustic backscatter signal which reflect bottom textural parameters. Cluster analysis is used to group together regions of similar acoustic backscatter characteristics, or classes. Once the acoustic classes were determined, they were correlated with bottom samples and imagery. Bottom grab samples were obtained using a Van Veen sampler with a 4-inch depth capacity. Sampling sites were chosen based on the side scan data. We took samples on acoustically distinct bottom types to confirm our estimates of those types. The seabed classification data were layered over the side scan mosaics and bathymetry. These data sets were used to correlate side scan reflectivity with acoustic seabed classes and detect any influences that abrupt changes in seafloor slope may have on the acoustic data. Steep slopes tend to scatter the acoustic signals and produce anomalous data. REFS: Conkwright, R. D. , Van Ryswick, S, Sylvia, E. R. 2014. Seafloor Survey of Nearshore Ocean City Maryland.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others.

The purpose of creating this file was to use MesoMap to create high-resolution wind maps of the state and to provide wind resource data in a format enabling the assessment of potential wind development sites in a GIS. By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower, LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data. Although it is believed to represent an accurate overall picture of the wind energy resource, estimates at any location should be confirmed by measurement. Last Updated: Unknown",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The TIGER\/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and\/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population\/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). Last Updated: 01\/1\/2010",

Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. The results will inform priorities for the City s digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City s efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013.",

Check out the Statewide Park and Ride System application, found on the Iowa DOT Interactive Map Portal.The Iowa Department of Transportation s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",

To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year.

It is the purpose of this section to enhance opportunities for the development and diversification of the state s economy through the identification and improvement of a network of commercial and industrial highways. The network shall consist of interconnected routes which provide long distance route continuity. The purpose of this highway network shall be to improve the flow of commerce; to make travel more convenient, safe, and efficient; and to better connect Iowa with regional, national, and international markets. The commission shall concentrate a major portion of its annual construction budget on this network of commercial and industrial highways. In order to ensure the greatest possible availability of funds for the improvement of the network, primary highway funds shall not be spent beyond continuing maintenance for improvements to route segments that will be bypassed by the relocation of portions of the commercial and industrial highway network.\t2. Network selection.a. The commission shall identify, within the primary road system, a network of commercial and industrial highways. The commission shall consider all of the following factors in the identification of this network: i. The connection by the most direct routes feasible of major urban areas and regions of the state to each other and to the national system of interstate and defense highways and priority routes in adjacent states. ii. The existence of high volumes of total traffic and commercial traffic. iii. Long distance traffic movements. iv. Area coverage and balance of spacing with service to major growth centers within the state. v. Metropolitan area bypasses consistent with metropolitan or regional area plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials.b. The network of commercial and industrial highways shall not exceed two thousand six hundred miles including municipal extensions of these highways.\t3. Standards. The department shall establish standards pertaining to the specific location, design, and access control for each segment of the commercial and industrial highways.\t4. Network development. In establishing priorities for improvement projects, the department shall take into consideration the following additional criteria: urban area bypasses that improve urban or regional accessibility or improve corridor travel; projects consistent with regional or metropolitan transportation plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials; and the willingness of local officials to provide financial or other assistance for the development of projects.Source: Iowa Code Section 313.2A Primary Roads: Commercial and Industrial Highways. http:\/\/search.legis.state.ia.us\/nxt\/gateway.dll\/ic\/1\/13\/10856\/10857\/11188\/11191 f=templatesfn=default.htm.",

"dc_description_s": "Properties are organized by the category in which they were phased in to the benchmarking program, with important metrics from the most recent reporting year of 2015 being toggleable. By clicking on a point, a user may learn more about an individual property's characteristics, energy efficiency, and water use from prior reporting years when available. Public buildings from the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Minneapolis Public Schools were phased in first and therefore show data for 2012-2015. The largest private buildings 100,000 sqft and greater, show publicly available data starting in 2014. The remaining category, private buildings between 50,000-100,000 sqft in size, data is made publicly available starting with the 2015 dataset. The toggleable metrics highlight the most summary information of building energy and water efficiency: ENERGY STAR score - The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country. The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours. A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer. The higher the score, the more efficient the building. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - The metric used for comparing buildings in Energy Star, EUI expresses a building s energy use relative to its size. In this report it is expressed as kBtu\/ft , and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (in kBtu) and dividing it by the floor area of the building (in ft ). The lower the kBtu\/ft , the lower the energy consumption. Weather-normalized Energy Use Intensity - Energy use is adjusted to account year-to-year weather differences, allowing for comparison of a building to itself over time. Through this procedure, the energy in a given year is adjusted to express the energy that would have been consumed under 30-year average weather conditions. Weather-normalized EUI also uses the kBtu\/ft unit. The maps provided by the City of Minneapolis are compilations of records, information and data from various sources, and they are to be used for reference purposes only. The City of Minneapolis does not warrant or guarantee that the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data or maps are complete, current, or accurate. The City of Minneapolis does not represent that the GIS data can be used for navigational, tracking, legal, engineering, surveying, or any other purpose requiring exacting measurement of distance or direction or precision in the depiction of geographic features.

In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size \/ extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive ('3'C') planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member'jurisdictions'has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:'National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)https:\/\/www.mwcog.org\/tpb\/- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland-'City'of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)https:\/\/baltometro.org\/- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)http:\/\/alleganygov.org\/473\/Metropolitan-Planning-Organization- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown \/ Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)https:\/\/www.hepmpo.net\/- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)http:\/\/www.wilmapco.org\/- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury \/ Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S \/ WMPO)http:\/\/www.swmpo.org\/- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland-'City'of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)http:\/\/www.calvert-stmarysmpo.com\/- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT).
