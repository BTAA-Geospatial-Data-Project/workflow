First-in districts represent the zone of first response for each Columbus fire station. They represent logical places a particular station can respond to faster than all other surrounding stations within the city of Columbus. These zones are re-evaluated and re-created, if necessary, each time a fire station is closed or opened.These polygons are also used for internal reporting purposes (number of runs, average response times...etc.)",
