Colors refer to a pickup schedule that may be accessed on the City's Refuse website. Pickup schedules identified by a color name are for 90-gallon container customers. The pickup schedule for other customer types, such as 300-gallon container and dumpster customers, are simply identified by the day of the week collection occurs (e.g. Monday).",
