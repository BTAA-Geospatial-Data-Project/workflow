  "dc_description_s": "Data updated daily between midnight and 6 am.Fields approved for biosolids application. Ohio EPA's biosolids program regulates the disposal and/or beneficial use of sewage sludge and biosolids generated by non-industrial wastewater treatment plants in Ohio, as well as any sewage sludge or biosolids brought into Ohio by out-of-state, non-industrial wastewater treatment plants. The goals of the biosolids program are to protect public health and the environment, encourage the beneficial reuse of biosolids and minimize the creation of nuisance odors.Ohio EPA is providing this map of authorized Class B biosolids beneficial use sites for use by all interested parties. The information presented within this map is accurate to the best of Ohio EPA's knowledge. Authorization for beneficial use of Class B biosolids does not mean biosolids have been used at the site. To learn if a site has actually received Class B biosolids, the treatment plant to which the site is authorized may be contacted. Exceptional Quality (EQ) biosolids do not need Ohio EPA authorization to be beneficially used, therefore, information on where these biosolids have been land applied is not available through Ohio EPA. Treatment plants that produce EQ biosolids may be contacted for more information regarding where their biosolids have been land applied.",
