  "dc_description_s": "Data updated daily between midnight and 6 am.The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination. To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Source Water Assessment and Protection (SWAP) Area- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Management Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. This data is updated, as needed, on a continual basis.For more information on the SWAP Program, visit epa.ohio.gov/ddagw/swap.aspx.",
