  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains point features representing the locations of Police Crime Cameras that have been installed throughout the City of Columbus. Public Safety Employees have the ability to monitor these cameras from numerous locations and request police when necessary. If an incident has already occurred, video can be retrieved and saved for future use. It is important to note that these cameras are not monitored 24/7.Division of Police GIS personnel obtained the Latitude and Longitude of each Crime Camera from the vendor, Tyco SimplexGrinnell, who installed the cameras to create this dataset. The Crime Cameras are one component of the Neighborhood Safety Program that initially began in 2011. The first camera installations began occurring in 2013 with new cameras still being added on a regular basis. This dataset is updated quarterly.The Columbus Division of Police can be reached by calling 911 for emergencies or by calling 614-645-4545 to report a non-emergency.",
