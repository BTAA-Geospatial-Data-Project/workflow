Dev.12.5919Scale of AnalysisThe optimal fixed distance band selected was based on peak clustering found at 55950.4284 Meters.Hot Spot AnalysisThere are 30 output features statistically significant based on a FDR correction for multiple testing and spatial dependence.OutputRed output features represent hot spots where high incident counts cluster.Blue output features represent cold spots where low incident counts cluster.",
