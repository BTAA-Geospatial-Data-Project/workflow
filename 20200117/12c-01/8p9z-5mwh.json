As opposed to elementary or high school attendance boundaries wherein each residing student is entitled to attend, charter boundaries simply serve as a guide for charter school administrators to use during the application/lottery process. Applicants residing within a specific boundary are generally given preference over applicants residing outside of the boundary.",
