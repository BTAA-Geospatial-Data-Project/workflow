  "dc_description_s": "The dataset contains polygons representing of MPD Police Sectors, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. In 2017 the Metropolitan Police Department formed an additional operational geographic layer called Sector. The Sector model brings additional management accountability to districts and allows for faster dispatch, lower response times, and improved service to the community. Sectors are made up of multiple Police Service Areas (PSAs) and are headed by a Captain. Please note that PSA is still an active operational model used by MPD; Sector is an additional layer between the PSA and District levels.",
