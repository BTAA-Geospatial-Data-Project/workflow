The dataset is a polygon representing the location and attributes of Central Employment Area (CEA) (the CEA is the core area of the District of Columbia where the greatest concentration of employment in the city and region is encouraged), created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. Jurisdictions were identified from public records (map and written description created by the National Capital Planning Commission) and heads-up digitized from the 1995 orthophotographs.
