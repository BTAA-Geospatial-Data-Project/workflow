  "dc_description_s": "The?Vision Zero?data contained in this layer pertain to moving violations issued by the District of Columbia's?Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)?and partner agencies with the authority to do so. For example, the?District Department of Transportation's (DDOT)?traffic control officers who?prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the?District?Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation.?The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 40 different combinations of violations.??Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, where are the majority of Unsafe Operator moving violations in the AM Rush of 2011? These data will give up to 52 distinct street segments of information ? one for each week of the year.Field Definitions:Identification?Weeknumber ?
