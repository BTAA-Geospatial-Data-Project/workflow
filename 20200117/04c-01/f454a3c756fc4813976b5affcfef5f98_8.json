The dataset contains polygons representing the L'Enfant Plan historic district, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. This district was identified from public records, including published maps and the National Register nomination form. It was created by buffering along the planimetric street centerline at specified distances, as referenced in the 1803 King Plats, ranging from 70 to 160 feet. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
