The day boundaries are the areas where trash and recycling collection takes place on a particular day. There are several routes within each day boundary. Each crew is assigned to collect either trash or recycling in one route per day. Supercan trash collection refers to the type of trash container used by the residents for setting out trash. Supercans are 96 gallon containers that are distributed by the City to citizens in residential (less urban and therefore less dense) neighborhoods that form the outer ring portion of the City. The routes within these day boundaries are collected once per week. Recycling containers are blue 35 gallon containers that are distributed to citizens in these same areas.",
