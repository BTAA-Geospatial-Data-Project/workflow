Once a tree is inspected by an arborist, the arborist will determine what measures should be taken in regard to the tree in question.?In the event of an emergency, such as broken or hanging limbs, or a tree is down blocking the flow of traffic or obscuring the view of a stop sign or other traffic sign, the DDOT's Urban Forestry Division will respond to mitigate the issue.",
