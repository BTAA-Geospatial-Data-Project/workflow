The dataset contains locations and attributes of 0.6 meter interval topography data, created using bare earth points from the lidar point cloud data.Voids exist in the data due to data redaction conducted under the guidance of the United States Secret Service. All lidar data returns and collected data were removed from the dataset based on the redaction footprint shapefile generated in 2017.",
