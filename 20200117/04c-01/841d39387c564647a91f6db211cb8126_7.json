These uses include residential and commercial uses at various densities, public land, institutional, federal, and industrial uses. Although planned uses and current uses may be similar, this is not a data set describing current land use. This is a generalized product, and cannot be used to identity specific uses for all specific locations in the District of Columbia.It is intended to guide zoning and development in the District. It is a visual depiction of District policy about appropriate land uses for various parts of the District. It is not intended to document existing conditions.",
