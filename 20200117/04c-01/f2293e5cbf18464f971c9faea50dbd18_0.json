There are 11 areas: Ward 1, Wards 2 and 3, Ward 4 north, Ward 4 south, Ward 5 north, Ward 5 south, Ward 6, Ward 7 north, Ward 7 south, Ward 8 north, and Ward 8 south. The data layer was created by using the ArcMap data editing trace tool. Boundary streets were selected and then the trace tool was used to create boundaries that conform to the street centerlines.",
