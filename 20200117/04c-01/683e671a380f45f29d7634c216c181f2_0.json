Masspoints and breaklines were compiled from Spring 2008 aerial photography using softcopy photogrammetric techniques. Breaklines typically occur at significant terrain breaks including street centerlines, hydrography, road edges, rail centerlines, and walls. Masspoints and breaklines were compiled to support generation of a TIN and the subsequent processing of 2 contours. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
