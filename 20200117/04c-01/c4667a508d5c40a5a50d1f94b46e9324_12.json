  "dc_description_s": "Recycling day boundaries in the conventional trash collection area of Washington DC. The day boundaries are the areas where recycling collection takes place on a particular day. There are several routes within each day boundary. Each crew is assigned to collect recycling in one route per day. Whereas trash is collected in the conventional area twice per week, recycling is collected once per week. Blue 35 gallon recycling containers are distributed to citizens in the conventional area as they are in the supercan area, but in the densest areas some residents receive recyling bins that are easier to store and manuver in areas where on-street parking is tight.",
