  "dc_description_s": "Sidewalk. The dataset contains polygons representing planimetric sidewalks, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These features were originally captured in 1999 and updated in 2005, 2008, and 2010. The following planimetric layers were updated: - Building Polygons (BldgPly) - Bridge and Tunnel Polygons (BrgTunPly) - Horizontal and Vertical Control Points (GeoControlPt) - Obscured Area Polygons (ObsAreaPly) - Railroad Lines (RailRdLn) - Road, Parking, and Driveway Polygons (RoadPly) - Sidewalk Polygons (SidewalkPly) - Wooded Areas (WoodPly) Two new layers were added: - Basketball and Other Recreation Courts (RecCourtPly) - Wheelchair Ramps (TransMiscPt).",
