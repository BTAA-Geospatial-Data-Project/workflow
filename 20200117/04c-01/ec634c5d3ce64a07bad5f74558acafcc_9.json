The dataset contains locations and attributes of CFA review areas, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. This layer captured all squares that bounded the Shipstead-Luce boundary. For the areas within this jurisdiction boundary and outside the Shipstead-Luce boundary, the applicant needs to check with CFA about review -- it doesn't automatically mean that review is required.
