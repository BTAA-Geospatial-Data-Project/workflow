These are not individual neighborhood boundaries. The Government of the District of Columbia does not provide official neighborhood boundaries however it does share common neighborhood labels as centroids.These do not reflect precise neighborhood locations and do not necessarily include all commonly-used neighborhood designations. However DC Government does share common neighborhood labels as centroids. There is no formal set of standards that describes which neighborhoods are included in this dataset. Note that the District of Columbia does not have official neighborhood boundaries.",
