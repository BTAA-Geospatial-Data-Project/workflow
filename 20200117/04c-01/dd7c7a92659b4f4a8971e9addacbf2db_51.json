  "dc_description_s": "ONE OR MORE OF THE ACCESS LINKS FOR THIS RECORD WERE REPORTED AS BROKEN. THE RECORD MAY HAVE BEEN RETIRED BY THE HOST. The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities' DC Creates! Public Art Program purchases, commissions, and installs artworks for public sites throughout the District of Columbia. The DC Creates! Public Art mission is to maintain a quality public collection of diverse media and to create a dynamic, vibrant, nurturing community through art and design. The program was established by 1986 legislation that allocates up to one percent of the District s adjusted Capital Budget for the commission and acquisition of artwork. Our program gives opportunities for individuals to encounter art in parks, libraries, community centers, government offices, bridges and other public venues. We simultaneously enrich the daily lives of residents and visitors and give voice to artists. The collection includes more than 100 permanently sited and integrated works and 2,500 portable works in District offices. http://dcarts.dc.gov/service/public-artThe DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities recognizes the importance of remaining relevant in a city of competitive opportunities for residents who have at their disposal significant discretionary income for arts and cultural offerings. Further, according to the 2012 Arts and Economic Prosperity IV Study conducted by Americans for the Arts, $1.1 billion in economic activity is generated annually by the non-profit arts and culture industry in Washington, DC. Additionally, the culture industry returns $80 million in local tax revenue to the District s coffers. These trends create an opportunity for DCCAH to position itself at the forefront of the city s cultural planning. To achieve this goal, DCCAH will endeavor in a cultural planning process to understand the strategic opportunities that will be central to accomplishing this broad vision.",
