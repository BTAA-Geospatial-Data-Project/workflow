  "dc_description_s": "Green Buildings (LEED) The LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System  is a voluntary, consensus-based national standard for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. Members of the U.S. Green Building Council representing all segments of the building industry developed LEED and continue to contribute to its evolution. LEED was created to: * Define green building by establishing a common standard of measurement * Promote integrated, whole-building design practices * Recognize environmental leadership in the building industry * Stimulate green competition * Raise consumer awareness of green building benefits * Transform the building market LEED provides a complete framework for assessing building performance and meeting sustainability goals. Based on well-founded scientific standards, LEED emphasizes state of the art strategies for sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. LEED recognizes achievements and promotes expertise in green building through a comprehensive system offering project certification, professional accreditation, training and practical resources.
