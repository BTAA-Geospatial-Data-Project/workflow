It contains TMDL Subsheds, Direct Drain Overland (not piped), Direct Drain Sewersheds (piped), and Combined Sewer (CSS) Subsheds. This data is a requirement of the District's MS4 Permit. It is used for stormwater management and all aspects supporting efforts to comply with the Clean Water Act in the District. This version is in local scale and may not nest with the current national watershed data. This layer provided the granularity needed to facilitate further analysis.",
