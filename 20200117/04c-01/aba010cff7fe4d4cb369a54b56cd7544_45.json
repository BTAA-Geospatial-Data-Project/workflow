  "dc_description_s": "The Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 established that all private buildings over 50,000 gross square feet within the District of Columbia, including multifamily residences, must annually measure and disclose their energy and water consumption to the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE). Benchmarking is defined as tracking a building s energy and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building s performance against past performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA s free, industry-standard ENERGY STAR  Portfolio Manager  tool for benchmarking and reporting. DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR  Benchmarking results for each publicly or privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking law, beginning with the 2nd year of benchmarking data for that building. For more information, see http://doee.dc.gov/energybenchmarking.",
