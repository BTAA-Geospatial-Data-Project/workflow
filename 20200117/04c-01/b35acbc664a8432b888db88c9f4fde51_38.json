The City Arts Projects (CAP) grant provides project support for individuals and organizations to execute projects that promote arts and humanities activities to a diverse range of communities within the District of Columbia. The DCCAH highly encourages small, medium and large projects that have District impact and engage District residents and visitors. Also, the DCCAH encourages community-based projects that share characteristics such as geographic location, common interests or a collective identity. Artistic projects may include, but are not limited to: concerts, visual arts exhibitions, literary readings, and festivals that feature dance, folk art, film, music, theater and other art forms. City Arts Projects will be reviewed by cohorts based on the project s artistic expense budget and projects produced by individuals or organizations.",
