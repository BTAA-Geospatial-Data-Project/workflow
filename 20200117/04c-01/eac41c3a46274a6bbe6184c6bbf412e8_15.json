  "dc_description_s": "The Industrial Revenue Bond program (IRB) provides access to tax-exempt financing to help businesses and non-profit organizations renovate and build new construction, make tenant improvements, and purchase capital by securing interest rates up 4% lower than a traditional commercial loan. IRBs can be used to finance, refinance, and reimburse the costs of acquiring, constructing, restoring, rehabilitating, expanding, improving, equipping, or furnishing real property and related subordinate facilities. More than $9.5 billion has been issued through Washington, DC's IRB program since 1994. Visit http://dmped.dc.gov for more information.",
