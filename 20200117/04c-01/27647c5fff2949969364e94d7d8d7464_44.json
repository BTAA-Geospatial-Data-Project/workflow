  "dc_description_s": "This dataset is a digital hydrologic unit boundary layer for the District of Columbia only - to the watershed (10-digit) 6th level at 1:24,000 scale. It is a clipped version of the regional dataset using the DC Boundary.This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries 3/01/02 (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/). The hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing large drainage areas. Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes, names, downstream hydrologic unit, flow modifications, and hydrologic unit type for 4th level (8-digit) sub-basin, 5th level (10-digit) watershed, 6th level (12-digit) subwatershed, and acres for subwatershed. An accompanying line shapefile is attributed with the highest hydrologic unit level for each hydrologic unit, linesource, and a metadata reference file.",
