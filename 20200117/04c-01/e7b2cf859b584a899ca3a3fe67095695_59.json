  "dc_description_s": "The locations of farmer's markets participating in the Department of Public Works' (DPW) Food Waste Drop-Off program. District residents may drop off food waste at these locations during the designated hours, which will then be converted to compost. DPW seeks to host one drop-off location for each ward, although this is subject to change from year to year and based on the seasonality of farmers' markets.Layer was compiled by the Office of Planning based on DPW's public listing of dropoff sites. Due to the frequent changing of these locations for farmers' market seasonal openings and closings, check DPW's website at https://dpw.dc.gov/foodwastedropoff for the most up-to-date locations.This dataset contains the following information about each location:Ward: The ward served by the drop-off location.MarketName: Name of the farmers' market hosting the drop-off.Address: Address of the farmers' market hosting the drop-off.SeasonOpen: Date on which the host farmers' market opens for the season.SeasonClose: Date on which the host farmers' market closes for the season.DropDay: Day on which residents may visit the host farmers' market to drop off food waste.DropTimes: Hours during which the drop-off will be open on the Drop Day.Last updated in November 2017.",
