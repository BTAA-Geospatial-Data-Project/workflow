Customers would interact via pay-by-phone or the MSM to pay for a particular parking space. The Pay-by-space environment has been used in the District since October 2015, when it first debuted in Penn Quarter/Chinatown. That area encompasses from 3rd St NW to 11th St NW and from E St NW to H St NW. Since that time, there has not been any further expansion of the Pay-by-Space Multi-Space Meter (MSM) Environment.
