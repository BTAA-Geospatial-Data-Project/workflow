  "dc_description_s": "Bridge and Tunnel. The dataset contains polygons representing planimetric Bridges and Tunnels, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These features were originally captured in 1999 and updated in 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013. The following planimetric layers were updated: - Building Polygons (BldgPly)- Bridge and Tunnel Polygons (BrgTunPly)- Grate (GratePly- Horizontal and Vertical Control Points (GeoControlPt) - Obscured Area Polygons (ObsAreaPly)- Railroad Lines (RailRdLn) - Road, Parking, and Driveway Polygons (RoadPly)- Sidewalk Polygons (SidewalkPly)- Stairs (StairPly)- Swimming Pools (SwmPoolPly)- Wooded Areas (WoodPly) All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
