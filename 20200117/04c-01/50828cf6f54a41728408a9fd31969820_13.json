  "dc_description_s": "Trash day boundaries in the conventional trash collection area of Washington DC. The day boundaries are the areas where trash collection takes place on a particular day. There are several routes within each day boundary. Each crew is assigned to collect trash in one route per day. Conventional trash collection refers to the type of trash container used by the residents for setting out trash. The smaller carts that are distributed by the City fit better in the more crowded areas of the central part of the City due to small or non-existent yards and tight alleys. Since the containers are smaller, trash in the conventional area of the City is collected twice a week. Therefore the Day boundaries are designated as Monday/Thursday or as Tuesday/Friday. For more information, visit https://dpw.dc.gov/service/trash-collection.",
