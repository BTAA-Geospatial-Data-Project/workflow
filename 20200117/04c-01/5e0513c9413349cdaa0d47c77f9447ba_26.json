This data highlights road ways where the Department of Public Works (DPW) will collect leaves at least twice by ?vacuuming? loose leaves residents rake into their treebox(es). Loose leaves will be sent for composting. In neighborhoods with alley trash/recycling collections, bagged leaves may be placed where trash and recycling are collected.
