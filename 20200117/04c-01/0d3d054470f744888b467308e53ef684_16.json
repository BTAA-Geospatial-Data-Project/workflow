Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. A database provided by the Department of Human Services identified catchment areas. Under its system redesign for the Homeless Services Program (HSP), the Department of Human Services is changing the way providers perform outreach services. As part of this redesign the District has been divided into 9 catchment areas. Contractors will submit proposals to provide outreach services in these areas. There is no overlap within these areas, and not every portion of the District falls within a catchment area. The areas are of varying size and the number of homelessness persons within each catchment area will vary and change over time.",
