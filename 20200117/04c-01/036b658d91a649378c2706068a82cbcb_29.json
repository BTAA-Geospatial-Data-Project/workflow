If a highway planning line crosses a particular property, that land cannot become a Record Lot by subdivision, even if the proposed street is no longer needed or will never be built. However there is a procedure through which a proposed road can be removed from the Highway Plan freeing up affected land for subdivision or development.Created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies.",
