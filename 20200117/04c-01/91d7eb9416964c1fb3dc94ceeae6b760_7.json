This dataset shows D.C. public middle school attendance areas, and added to the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). The boundaries were recommended by the Advisory Committee on Student Assignment and accepted by the Mayor. These new boundaries will go into effect in the 2015-16 school year and significant phasing in policies will be put into place. See DME.dc.gov for more information.
