DDOT's Urban Forestry Administration (UFA) prunes the District's street trees to maintain the trees overall health, form, and safety for the area around the tree. Trees are also pruned to give clearance over sidewalks and roadways, followed by minor roadways, alleys (to allow passage for sanitation and emergency vehicles), and pedestrian walkways. DDOTs UFA will make the final determination regarding the viability of pruning a tree.",
