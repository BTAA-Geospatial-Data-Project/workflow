  "dc_description_s": "Existing Landuse This Spatial Data contains 2004 Existing Land Use delineations for Washington District of Columbia. The layer was developed to support in the Comprehensive Plan review process currently underway by the DC Office of Planning Long Range Planning Division. The layer boundaries are a combination of 1999 planimetrics, DC Property Square Index boundaries that were manually split along scanned, raster tax lot boundaries.This data is used for the planning and management of Washington by local government agencies. Stereotype areas using DC Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) owner points and use codes as the first step; supplement with additional data layers and corrections based on manual review as needed. The end product should be a land inventory and associated maps sufficiently accurate to indicate for planning purposes how lands are currently being used in DC. This effort is launched in advance of the availability of digitized lot boundaries for DC, and will be revised when they become available.",
