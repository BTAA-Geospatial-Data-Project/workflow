  "dc_description_s": "Best Management Practices (BMPs) are structural controls used to manage stormwater runoff. Examples include green roofs, rain gardens, and cisterns. BMPs reduce the effects of stormwater pollution and help restore the District s water bodies. The District s stormwater regulations require that large construction or renovation projects install BMPs to manage stormwater runoff once construction is complete. The District also provides financial incentives for properties that install BMPs voluntarily. This dataset includes BMPs that were installed to comply with the District s stormwater regulations, to participate in the Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) trading program, to participate in the RiverSmart Homes program, to participate in the Green Roof Rebate program, or to participate in the RiverSmart Rewards stormwater fee discount program. These BMPs have been reviewed by the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) as part of these programs. This dataset is updated weekly with data from the District s Stormwater Database.",
