  "dc_description_s": "Snow Emergency Roads. The District of Columbia Snow Team works closely with the Mayor and other District agencies when deciding to declare and enforce snow emergencies. If a snow emergency is declared residents must immediately relocate any vehicles parked on snow emergency routes. The Snow Team consists of the Department of Public Works and the Department of Transportation, with support from: DC Water, Department of Corrections, Department of General Services, Department of Parks and Recreation. Snow Emergency Vehicle Towing Policy: If a vehicle is not moved off a snow emergency route when a snow emergency has been declared, DPW will tow the vehicle to a pre-determined lot. DPW will no longer relocate the vehicle in the local neighborhood. The resident will incur a $250 fine for parking on a snow emergency route during a declared snow emergency, a $100 towing fee and a $25 impound fee (this fee will double after 48 hours and then increase by $25 every 24 hours thereafter). For more information visit http://snow.dc.gov. During winter weather storms, use http://snowmap.dc.gov to view live traffic cameras and review road treatments around the city.",
