Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. The USGS presents a detailed explanation of HUCs at http://water.usgs.gov/gis/huc.html. HUC-11 boundaries are compiled by each state. The export files of HUC-11 at the state level were provided by each respective state and are unmodified. HUC-11 boundaries for Delaware are not yet available. Also, a small portion of the Chesapeake Basin in NY State has not yet been completed.
