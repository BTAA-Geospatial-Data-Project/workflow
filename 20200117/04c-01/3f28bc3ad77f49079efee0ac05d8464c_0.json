  "dc_description_s": "The Vision Zero Safety data comes from a web-based application developed to allow the public to communicate the real and perceived dangers along the roadway from the perspective of either a pedestrian, bicyclist or motorist. The data is captured from a site visitor who can click or tap on a location to report a transportation hazard.  Vision Zero is a part of Mayor Bowser s response to the US Department of Transportation s Mayor s Challenge for Safer People and Safer Streets, which aims to improve pedestrian and bicycle transportation safety by showcasing effective local actions, empowering local leaders to take action, and promoting partnerships to advance pedestrian and bicycle safety.Vision Zero requires an all-hands-on-deck approach. More than 20 District government agencies are engaged in the Vision Zero Initiative, including DDOT, Department of Public Works, the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services, Metropolitan Police Department, DC Taxi Cab Commission, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the DC Office on Aging, DC Public Schools, Fire and Emergency Medical Services, Homeland Security and Management, Office of Unified Communications, Department of Health, the Office of the Attorney General, Office of the Chief Technology Officer, Office of Disability Rights, Office of Planning, Office of the City Administrator, Office of the State Superintendent of Education, the Deputy Mayor for Education, Office of Policy and Legislative Affairs, and the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development.Visit the web application at http://visionzero.ddot.dc.gov/VisionZero/.  Contact the Vision Zero team at vision.zero@dc.gov.Please note that this map is not DC's 311 service request system. Department of Transportation (DDOT) staff will investigate the concerns identified on this map and if necessary, submit a 311 request on behalf of the site visitor.  Users always have the option to submit a separate 311 service request at http://311.dc.gov/.",
