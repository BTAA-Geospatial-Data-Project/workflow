Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). These features were originally captured in 1999 and updated in 2005 and 2008. The following planimetric layers were updated using 2008 imagery - Grates (GratePt) - Bollards (BollardPt) - Stairs (StairPly) - Pools (SwmPoolPly). All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
