  "dc_description_s": "The Lane Mile Inventory is a GPS assisted windshield survey data collection of the number of lanes on any given segment of Michigan state highway (trunkline). Another description could refer to it as a striped lane mile inventory. The definition of a lane mile is one mile of roadway that is intended for driving. The LMI supports the delivery of annual maintenance and capital funds to MDOT's regions. Attributes that are collected with this effort are number of lanes, lane function, maintenance responsibility, road type, speed limit, bike lanes, on street parking, and sidewalks. Please see the MDOT Metadata Form for additional information. Update Cycle: The yearly release of the LMI represents changes to the existing roadway (number of drivable lanes) that are submitted by the regions from new projects every year. The entire system is updated on a 5-year cycle.Data Quality: Data is collected to +/- 25ft accuracy using a laptop equipped with ArcGIS Desktop and a tethered USB puck GPS unit.Coverage: This inventory is complete in its coverage of all State of Michigan trunkline roadways.Symbology: The symbology for the LMI is categorized using the current LANE_YEAR field with different colors for each lane number and a size 2 line.Contact: Kevin McKnight, mcknightk@michigan.gov",
