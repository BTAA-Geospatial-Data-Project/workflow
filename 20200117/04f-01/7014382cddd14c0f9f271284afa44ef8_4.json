The HSIP emphasizes a data-driven, strategic approach to improving highway safety that focuses on results. Under the enabling transportation legislation enacted in December 2015, Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST), New Jersey receives approximately $57 million annually for safety improvements. The HSIP requires a statewide strategic highway safety plan to set goals and prioritize safety investments. The HSIP also requires annual progress reporting to the FHWA.",
