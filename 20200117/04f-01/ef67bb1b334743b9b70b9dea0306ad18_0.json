Almost all system expansion projects are Major Regional Projects, as are reconstruction projects on the region s freeways. Major Operational Improvement initiatives, such as SEPTA s fare modernization project, are also listed in the Plan. For the sake of brevity, smaller-scale projects that were identified in the needs assessment are not listed in the Plan document. Instead, the various funding categories in the Plan serve as placeholders for their funding, and they may be explicitly listed in future iterations of the TIP.",
