  "dc_description_s": "New Jersey Urban Boundaries - The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), Bureau of Transportation Data and Safety (BTDS), in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is required to update the urban area and functional classification of roadways following the decennial Census as part of the Federal-Aid highway funding program. This dataset contains the updated urban area boundaries for the 2010 Census update cycle (recently updated in the Winter of 2017)NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population = 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are = 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is = 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas = 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (smoothed) to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area. All comments were logged into an Urban Area Comment Tracking Form, and an official NJDOT response was provided for each comment.Pennsylvania Urban Boundaries - Urban area boundaries within Pennsylvania based on U.S Census Bureau maps.",
