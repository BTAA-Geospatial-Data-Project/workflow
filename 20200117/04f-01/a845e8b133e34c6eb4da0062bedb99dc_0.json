This dataset includes fully parsed address information and additional roadway characteristics. It provides the geometric framework for display and query of relevant non-spatial data published as separate tables that can be joined to the feature class. The enhancement process included integration of multiple data sets, primarily those developed and maintained by county agencies in New Jersey and the US Census Bureau.",
