  "dc_description_s": "This layer represents footprints of transit parking facilities in the DVRPC region. Additionally, parking facilities at stations on SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line in New Castle County, Delaware (and several park ride lots in that county) are included. The features in this layer were generated by digitizing all discernable parking areas that are associated with transit facilities using the best available aerial imagery. In many cases, Google Street View was used to help determine whether a parking area was part of a transit facility, or designated as being available for use by transit facility patrons.Although efforts were made to ensure this layer's completeness and accuracy, it is not a definitive inventory of the region's transit parking facilities and should not be considered as such.",
