The Top [x] Percent attributes show whether the segment is in the top [x] percent in the county. The percentages are based on the number of connections between Census blocks that would be enabled if LTS was reduced to 1 or 2 along these segments. A value of 1 in the percentage attribute means the segment falls in that percentage, while a value of 0 means that it does not.",
