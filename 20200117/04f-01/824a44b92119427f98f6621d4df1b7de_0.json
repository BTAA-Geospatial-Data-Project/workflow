The RASP currently contains 24 airports: 3 commercial, 10 reliever, and 11 general aviation or recreational facilities. In addition, the current RASP identifies three operating public use heliports and one military airbase. The DVRPC_REG field indicates whether a facility is within the DVRPC 9-county region.Additional attribute data pertaining to these facilities may be sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA provides airport data for the entire United States via various downloadable tables: http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/",
