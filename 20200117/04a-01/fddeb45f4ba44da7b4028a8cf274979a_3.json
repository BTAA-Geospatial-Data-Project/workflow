Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The Natural Filter Buffer Priorities for Water Quality (Phosphorus / Sediment) layers identify priority forest/grass buffer opportunities by subwatershed (MD HUC 8). The Natural Filter Buffer Targeting layers were used as a baseline for suitability rankings. Land use, hydrology, soil, and landscape characteristics were analyzed to rank buffer opportunities with high phosphorus and sediment removal potential.Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_NaturalFilters/MapServer/3",
