Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This dataset contains summary statistics from the 1973, 2002, and 2010 land use/land cover datasets. The purpose of the 2010 land use/land cover data set is to provide a generalized view of how developed land has changed throughout the state, primarily capturing the conversion of resource land to development and characterizing the type of development (e.g. very low density, low density, medium density or high density residential development, commercial, industrial, institutional).Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/PlanningCadastre/MD_LandUseLandCover/MapServer/0",
