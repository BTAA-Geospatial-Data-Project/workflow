  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This dataset provides a digital geospatial representation of regulated facility outfalls using data derived from various source data. The process by which this data set has been developed has been guided by Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and is the result of multiple geoprocesses. It is important to note that point locations are approximate and many do not represent exact geographic locations of outfalls, rather the parcel that they are located in. It is also important to note that in some cases, due to the way the data was processed, outfalls and facilities may have the same coordinates, leading to points being stacked.Feature Service Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_PointSourceDischarges/FeatureServer/1",
