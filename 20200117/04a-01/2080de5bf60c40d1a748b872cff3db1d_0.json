  "dc_description_s": "Baltimore City's Freight Network consists of linear features which represent the street centerlines of the official truck routes in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. The purpose of this data is to identify through, local, and restricted truck routes within Baltimore City. These routes specify where large trucks are allowed to drive, for the use by truck operators, trucking companies, and City transportation offices. The linear geometric features of this dataset were created by merging the National Highway Freight Network (NHFN) (https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/nfn/index.htm) with Baltimore City's Freight Network (data provided by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation). A NHFN_ID field is provided to distinguish City freight routes that are also a part of the NHFN. Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) values from 2017 are provided for each line segment where applicable. AADT values and percent utilization are provided for each vehicle classification (Motorcycle, Car, Light Truck, Single Unit Truck and Combination Unit Truck). A Freight AADT field and a Freight Percent Utilization field are also provided. Freight AADT was calculated by summing Single Unit Truck (FHWA Class 5 to 7) and Combination Unit Truck (FHWA Class 8 to 13) AADT values. Freight Percent Utilization was calculated by dividing the Freight AADT by the total AADT. Light Trucks (FHWA Class 3) were intentionally excluded from the Freight AADT and Freight Percent Utilization as these vehicles are not restricted to traversing on the City's freight network. AADT data was obtained from the Annual Average Daily Traffic - MDOT SHA Statewide AADT Lines layer on MD iMAP (https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Transportation/MD_AnnualAverageDailyTraffic/FeatureServer/1). Every reasonable effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of these data. The City of Baltimore, Maryland makes no representations nor warranties, either expressed or implied, regarding the accuracy of this information or its suitability for any particular purpose whatsoever. The data is licensed \"as is\" and the City of Baltimore will not be liable for its use or misuse by any party. Reliance of these data is at the risk of the user. Last updated: 10/07/2019",
