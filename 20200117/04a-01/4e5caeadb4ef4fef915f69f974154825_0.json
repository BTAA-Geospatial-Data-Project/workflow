Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.This point dataset represents Tier II MBSS stations sampled by the Maryland Department of the Environment. Each point represents either one benthic macroinvertebrate station location or one fish station location. This dataset currently contains 108 points, based on data collected between 2012 2016. This dataset also includes potential sites for 2017 monitoring.Creator: Maryland Department of the Environment, Science Services Administration (MDE SSA) Assessment Data: MDE SSAThe Maryland Department of the Environmental shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein.
