  "dc_description_s": "This dataset provides the Tier II catchments delineated for the most downstream Tier II segment. This file also provides the assimilative capacity (AC) status for each watershed. In cases where there is no remaining AC in a nested catchment but the larger encompassing segment has remaining AC, the smaller nested catchment is split out and assigned its own identification. These nested catchments are also then attributed to show the lack of AC remaining. The intended use of the catchment dataset is to assist State, Local, and Federal officials and stakeholders in determining the antidegradation status of current or planned activities which fall under the purview of the antidegradation policy and implementation procedure (COMAR 26.08.02.04-1).  Using GIS, the stakeholder can assess if any activity, proposed or operational, such as a discharge, is located on land which drains (has run off) directly into and can potentially adversely affect a Tier II stream segment.  This type of determination would be useful for permitting purposes, screening for sensitive or high quality resources, and various land use planning activities such as those undertaken by local officials during the Water Resources Element process, Water and Sewer Planning, or the Comprehensive Planning process.This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer.
