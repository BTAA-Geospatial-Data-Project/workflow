The nominal pulse spacing for this project was 1 point every 0.7 meters. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to project specifications: 0-Never Classified, 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Low Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro-conditioned DEMs for the project area. The data was formatted according to the Baltimore County tile naming convention.Image Service Link: https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Baltimore/MD_baltimore_shadedRelief_RGB/ImageServer",
