  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The Communities of Opportunity designated on the Maryland QAP Comprehensive Opportunity Maps are based on a Composite Opportunity Index developed by DHCD. The Composite Opportunity Index uses publicly - available data and is based on three major factors: community health, economic opportunity, and educational opportunity. To be designated a Community of Opportunity, and mapped as such to the Maryland QAP Comprehensive Opportunity Maps, the community must have a Composite Opportunity Index that it is above the statewide average. See Section 3.1 of the Program Guide for more details. http://dhcd.maryland.gov/HousingDevelopment/Documents/rhf/MD%20Rental%20Financing%20Program%20Guide%20Final%205.8.15.pdfFeature Service Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BusinessEconomy/MD_HousingDesignatedAreas/FeatureServer/2",
