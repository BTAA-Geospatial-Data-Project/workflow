  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This file (SWSHED12) is a statewide digital watershed file. It was created primarily for state and federal agency use. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p. 1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. Some watersheds drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area watershed were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres. The watershed boundaries in this file were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file. This file contains all of the HUA14 watersheds and some added watersheds to maintain water quality sampling sites. It was also used to create the Maryland Sub-Watershed file.The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
