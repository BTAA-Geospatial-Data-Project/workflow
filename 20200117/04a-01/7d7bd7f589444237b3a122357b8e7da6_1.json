  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City.SLAMM uses elevation, accumulation of sediments, wetland accretion and erosion rates, and sea level rise to predicatively model long-term wetland and shoreline change. In Maryland, SLAMM was run using the best available science, including sea level rise rate identified at 3.4 feet by year 2100. The resulting changes to coastal marshes and shorelines can be visualized in their current state, 2050 and 2100 year scenarios. These results will be used to help frame new land conservation targeting in Maryland's coastal zone.
