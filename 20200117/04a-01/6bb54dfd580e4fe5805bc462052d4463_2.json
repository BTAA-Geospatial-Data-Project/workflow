  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The intent of this dataset is for it to be used to produce maps and provide a spatial reference for all Tier II segments located in Maryland. The Clean Water Act requires that States review their water quality standards every three years and revise the standards as necessary. During this required Triennial Review the State reviewed the antidegradation policy, and identified additional stream segments that meet the minimum requirements. Current Tier II designations are made based on biological characteristics from Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data, which is collected annually. MBSS data which identifies new Tier II segments in between Triennial Review cycles are maintained on the pending list, as they are awaiting formal promulgation. The publicly maintained list of all Tier II waters can be found for each county at the following website: http://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Water/TMDL/Integrated303dReports/Pages/Antidegradation.aspx. This dataset is intended to be used in conjunction with the other official Tier II MDE datasets: Tier II Stream Catchments, Tier II MBSS Stations, and Tier II Stream Endpoints.Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/2",
