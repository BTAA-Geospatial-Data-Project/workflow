Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The Sensitive Areas Foragers and Grazers dataset shows areas within Maryland's Coastal Bays that are significant for aquatic Forager and Grazer populations. The areas less than 3 feet deep are important to Foragers and Grazers. This dataset shows cumulative seasonal use. It does not break out the seasonality of use of certain areas of the Bays by aquatic Foragers and Grazers.Feature Service Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Biota/MD_Finfish/FeatureServer/12",
