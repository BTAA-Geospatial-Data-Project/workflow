  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Interchange Exits data consists of point feature geometry which represent the geographic location of interchange exits along public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Interchange Exits data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Interchange Exits data is key to understanding the location of interchange exits along roadways throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Interchange Exits data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017. Last Updated: September 2018 (09/2018) For additional information, contact the MDOT SHA Geospatial Technologies Email: GIS@mdot.state.md.us For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Website: https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA): Website: https://roads.maryland.gov/Home.aspx MDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer: The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.
