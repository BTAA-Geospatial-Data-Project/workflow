  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset is a survey of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland. The project area consists of approximately 500 square miles. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 0.70 meters. Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 151 flight lines in eight lifts on February 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16, 2011; in tidal areas, data was collected within 2 hours (before or after) of mean low tide. The data was divided into 1500 by 1500 meter cells that serve as the tiling scheme. LiDAR data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. This data of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland, was collected at sufficient resolution to provide a nominal point spacing of 0.70 meters for collected points. Up to 4 returns were recorded for each pulse in addition to an intensity value.Image Service Link: https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Worcester/MD_worcester_aspect_m/ImageServer",
