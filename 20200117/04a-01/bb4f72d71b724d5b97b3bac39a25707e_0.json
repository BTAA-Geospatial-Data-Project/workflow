  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. The results of SLAMM were analyzed for specific conservation criteria for long-term planning that may help increase coastal resiliency in Maryland. The conservation criteria included areas that may support future wetland migration, wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors, high priority aquatic and terrestrial living resources, vulnerable wetland habitat, suitable hydric soils for wetland establishment and marsh-dependent breeding bird habitat. From these criteria a conservation model was developed to prioritize the most important areas for wetland adaptation. As a result the top priorities were used to create the Wetland Adaptation Areas for the Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) used in Marylands GreenPrint.
