Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.The Biodiversity Conservation Network (or BioNet) of Maryland layer systematically identifies and prioritizes ecologically important lands to conserve Marylands biodiversity (i.e., plants, animals, habitats, and landscapes). This dataset aggregates numerous separate data layers hierarchically according to the BioNet Criteria Matrix. These data were needed to maximize the influence and effectiveness of public and private conservation investments; promote shared responsibilities for land conservation between public and private sectors; and guide and encourage compatible land uses and land management practices.
