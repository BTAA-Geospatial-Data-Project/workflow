Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This data layer contains the Province-level physiographic subdivisions of Maryland in ArcGIS format. The file was developed from components of a detailed digital physiographic map of Maryland by James P. Reger and Emery T. Cleaves, currently in progress. Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it. The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive. Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure, rock type, geomorphic history, and topographic characteristics. Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100,000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows, in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province, Section, Region, District, Area. In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. In this file, the polygons reflect Province level subdivision. The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level. The table includes information on dominant rock types, geologic structure, topographic relief, and drainage pattern.
