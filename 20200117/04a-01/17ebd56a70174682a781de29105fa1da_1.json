Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This is a comprehensive point theme that incorporates Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) core property characteristics, including summary building characteristics for the property, associated with a given parcel account number (ACCTID field). Data for the CAMA Core point theme are obtained from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation for all jurisdictions on a yearly basis. This is a single record per parcel account number point theme. All other CAMA point themes, Building, Building Subareas and Land, can be joined to this point theme. For more information on the attribute definitions please see the MdProperty View User's Guide, available for download at http://planning.maryland.gov/OurProducts/downloadFiles.shtml. CAMA attribute definitions can be found in Appendix D of the User's Guide.
