  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.SLAMM uses elevation, accumulation of sediments, wetland accretion and erosion rates, and sea level rise to predicatively model long-term wetland and shoreline change. In Maryland, SLAMM was run using the best available science, including sea level rise rate identified at 3.4 feet by year 2100. The resulting changes to coastal marshes and shorelines can be visualized in their current state, 2050 and 2100 year scenarios. These results will be used to help frame new land conservation targeting in Maryland's coastal zone.
