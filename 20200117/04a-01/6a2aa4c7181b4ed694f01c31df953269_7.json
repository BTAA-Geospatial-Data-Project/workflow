  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.Funding for this data set was provided by two Projects of Special Merit (CZM # 14-14-1868 CZM 143 and CZM # 14-15-2005 CZM 143), funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and made available to MGS through the Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Chesapeake and Coastal Service (CCS). MGS wishes to thank the following project partners: 1) MD DNR CCS, Contact: Mr. Chris Cortina, Role: CCS Project Manager; 2) NOAA, Contact: Mr. Doug Graham, NOAA National Geodetic Survey, Role: Project partner source of historical and recent shorelines; 3) MD DNR Critical Areas Commission (CAC), Contact: Ms. Lisa Hoerger, Role: Project partner source of recent shorelines; 4) Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative (ESRGC), Salisbury University, Contact: Ryan Mello, Role: Performing the critical area re-mapping for MD DNR CAC and supplying MGS with CAC shorelines; and 5) Ms. Lamere Hennesse, MGS Geologist, retired, Role: Project guidance technical support.Map Service Link: https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_ShorelineChanges/MapServer/7",
