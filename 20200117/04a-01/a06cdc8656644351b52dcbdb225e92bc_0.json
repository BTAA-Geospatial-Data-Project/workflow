Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Secretary Salazar announced the Department of the Interior's Smart from the Start initiative on November 23, 2010. As part of this initiative, a critical element is the identification of Wind Energy Areas (WEA) on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the Atlantic coast. WEAs are offshore locations that appear most suitable for wind energy development. Secretary Salazar identified the WEAs on February 7, 2011 in a joint announcement with Secretary Chu of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the National Strategic Work Plan for Offshore Wind. Data has been and will continue to be collected for these high priority areas to inform government and industry assessments and planning, allowing a more efficient process for permitting and siting responsible development. Requests for Interest (RFIs) and Calls for Information have been or will be issued for these new WEAs to support lease sale environmental assessments. The data was developed within the U.S. Government; no proprietary rights may be attached to them nor may they be sold to the U.S. Government as part of any procurement of ADP products or services.Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/UtilityTelecom/MD_OffshoreWindEnergyPlanning/FeatureServer/0",
