  "dc_description_s": "This imagery was acquired (on August 29, 2011) by the NOAA Remote Sensing Division to support NOAA national security and emergency response requirements. This rapid response product was generated for use by emergency managers for visual analysis of damage in the area. It is not intended for mapping, charting or navigation. In addition, it will be used for ongoing research efforts for testing and developing standards for airborne digital imagery. Complete flight metadata can be found at: https://geodesy.noaa.gov/storm_archive/storms/irene/docs/irene_metadata.htmThis is a MD iMAP hosted service.
