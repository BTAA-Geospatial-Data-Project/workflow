Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This layer is extracted from The High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus HR). This is an integrated set of geospatial data layers, including the best available National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), the 10-meter 3D Elevation Program Digital Elevation Model (3DEP DEM), and the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The NHDPlus HR combines the NHD, 3DEP DEMs, and WBD to create a stream network with linear referencing, feature naming, value added attributes (VAAs), elevation-derived catchments, and other features for hydrologic data analysis.Map Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Agriculture/MD_NutrientManagementSetbacksFromWaterways/MapServer/6",
