  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.Coastal storm and flood events may increase the likelihood of danger or damage to life and property as a consequence of inundation and shoreline erosion. These hazards are caused by storms and exacerbated by sea level rise. The Community Flood Risk Areas represent residential areas at risk to coastal flooding where populations may be less equipped to prepare for, respond to, or recover from a coastal hazard event. Risk Areas are ranked from 1 to 5 to indicate relative risk, with 1 indicating very low risk and 5 indicating very high risk. Risk rankings incorporate population density, social parameters (i.e. age, income, language proficiency), and probability of exposure to a flood hazard event in any one given year. 2013 US Census Bureau American Community Survey, 2010 Maryland Department of Planning land use land cover, and effective FEMA floodplain data as of December 2015 were used to identify and rank risk areas. This dataset was produced under award number NA13NOS4190136 from the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Chesapeake and Coastal Services (CCS). The statements, finding and recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the U.S. Department of Commerce.
