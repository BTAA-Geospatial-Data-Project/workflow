  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway National Highway System (NHS) consists of linear geometric features which specifically show public roadways included in the National Highway System (NHS) within the State of Maryland. Roadway National Highway System (NHS) data is classified by NHS Description Type, which includes Expanded NHS, Major Airport, Major Inter-City Bus Terminal, Major Pipeline Terminal, MAjor Port Facility, Major Transportatio or Multi-Modal Passengar Terminal, Major Rail / Truck Terminal, and Non-Connector NHS. Roadway National Highway System (NHS) data is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway National Highway System (NHS) data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway National Highway System (NHS) data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway National Highway System (NHS) data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway National Highway System (NHS) data is key to understanding and identifying which roadways are included within the NHS from the State of Maryland.Roadway NHS data is updated and published on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2017.
