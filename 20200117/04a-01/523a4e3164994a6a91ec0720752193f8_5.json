Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov.The Impoundment feature class is the official geospatial representation of the major impoundments assessed (for the Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality) within Maryland. Impoundments within this feature class are linked, through a relationship class, to a table that provides the specific water quality assessment information for that impoundment. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.Map Service Link: https://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDE_Water_Quality/MD_IntegratedReport_SurfaceWaterQuality2014/MapServer/5",
