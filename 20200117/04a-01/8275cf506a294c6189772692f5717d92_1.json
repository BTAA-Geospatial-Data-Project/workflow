Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census 2010 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).Feature Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Demographics/MD_CensusBoundaries/MapServer/1",
