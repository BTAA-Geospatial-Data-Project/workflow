  "dc_description_s": "The National Hydrography Dataset Plus High Resolution (NHDPlus HR) is a geospatial model for the flow of water across the landscape and through the stream network. The dataset is built using data at 1:24,000 scale or better. The dataset expands on the NHD with additional attribute data. This layer uses the NHDPlus HR to create a Pennsylvania-wide Strahler stream order database. For watersheds where NHDPlus HR stream order data was unavailable (Erie and Genesee Watersheds), an analyst manually determined and entered stream orders to complete the data. In addition to stream order, the layer includes unique identifiers for stream reaches to allow joins with other stream datasets built off the NHD, such as the PA Department of Environmental Protection attaining and non-attaining streams layers.",
