  "dc_description_s": "The following data set contains all the Oil & Gas Wells in Pennsylvania that the Dept of Enviromental Protection has locational information on. The wells are broken into two formation types of conventional and unconventional wells. A conventional well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of oil or natureal gas from only conventional formation(s). A conventional formation is any formation that does not meet the statutory definition of an unconventional formation. An unconventional gas well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of natural gas from an unconventional formation. Unconventional formation is a geological shale formation existing below the base of the Elk Sandstone or its geologic equivalent stratigraphic interval where natural gas generally cannot be produced at economic flow rates or in economic volumes except by vertical or horizontal well bores stimulated by hydraulic fracture treatments or by using multilateral well bores or other techniques to expose more of the formation to the well bore.",
