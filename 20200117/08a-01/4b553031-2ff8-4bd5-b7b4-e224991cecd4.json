  "dc_description_s": "The Coastal Zone Boundary delineates Pennsylvania's two coastal zones: the Delaware Estuary Coastal Zone located in southeastern Pennsylvania, and the Lake Erie Coastal Zone located in the northwestern part of the state. The federal Coastal Zone Management Act (Act) defines the coastal zone as coastal waters and the adjacent shorelands, strongly influenced by each other. The zone extends inland from the shoreline only to extend necessary to control shorelands, the uses of which have a direct and significant impact on the coastal waters. The boundary is used as a starting point by persons or agencies to determine if their proposed activities will affect the coastal zones, and are subject to review by the Pennsylvania Coastal Zone Management Program. Further, local municipalities, authorities, state agencies and certain non-profit organizations within these boundaries are eligible for Coastal Zone grants to support the goals and objectives of the Act at the local and state level. Federal actions (eg. federal development activities, federal permits and licenses, federal assistance, and Outer Continental Shelf activities) occurring within the coastal boundary, or outside the boundary but impacting upon it, are subject to the federal consistency review requirements of the Act. In addition, applications for state Department of Environmental Protection permits for activities located in the coastal zones are subject to review and approval by Pennsylvania's CZM Program.",
