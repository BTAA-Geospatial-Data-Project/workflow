The data layer contains all annotation used in producing the atlas. This data set comprises a portion of the ESI data for the Hudson River. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. Data includes: HYDRO, ESI, WETLANDS, BIRDS, FISH, INVERT, MAMMAL(Marine), MAMMAL(Terrestrial), HABITATS, REPTILES, MGT, INDEX, SOCECON, RVRMILES, SENSITIV, STAGING.",
