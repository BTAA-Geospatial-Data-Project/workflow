  "dc_description_s": "An elevation or topgraphic contour is a line that connects a series of points of equal elevation and is used to illustrate topography, or relief, on a map. It shows the height of ground above Mean Sea Level (M.S.L.). Numerous contour lines that are close together indicate hilly or mountainous terrain; when far apart, they represent a gentler slope. This layer consists of contours at a five foot interval for DVRPC's 9-county region and was generated from an aerial topographic survey in 2005.The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's (DVRPC) 9-county region is made up of the following: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania; and Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey.\",)",
