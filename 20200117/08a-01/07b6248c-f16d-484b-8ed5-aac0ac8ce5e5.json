The 6 subbasins include the Upper Susquehanna, Chemung, Middle Susquehanna, West Branch Susquehanna, Juniata, and Lower Susquehanna. This file was created by dissolving the wshed24K dataset into the 6 major subbasins. The boundary between the Upper Susq. and Chemung Subbasins was updated to match the SRBC delineated subbasin line that exists on 1:24,000 scale USGS topographic maps.",
