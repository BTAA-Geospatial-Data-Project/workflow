  "dc_description_s": "This dataset represents a snapshot of forest fragmentation on state forest land as of December 31, 2012. The data was derived from the Bureau of Forestrys fragmentation analysis in the April 2014 Shale Gas Monitoring Report using the University of Connecticuts Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LTF) v 2.0 and the Bureau of Forestrys data. The results categorize state forest land into: 1) small core patches less than 100 hectares, 2) Medium core patches with an area between 100 and 200 hectares, 3) Large core patches greater than 200 hectares, 4) Non-forested area, 5) Forest Edge, 6) Perforated forest, and 7) Patch forest. The default 100 meters was used to define forest edge. The fragmentation model considers all changes and is not limited to just shale gas activities (non-shale gas related changes do affect the results of this analysis too).
