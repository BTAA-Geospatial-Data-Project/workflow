  "dc_description_s": "This raster dataset has been created using inputs including PA Ordered Streams data and Land Cover (PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005 - downloaded from PASDA). 100 foot buffers of the ordered streams were assigned value based on the Strahler stream order and the potential aquatic habitat values. The average conservation value for riparian buffers of 1-2 ordered streams, 3-5 ordered streams, and 6-12 ordered streams were then calculated for the small watersheds. Each of the above groups were then weighted and added together and quantiled into 10 classes to create an overall Riparian Buffer Quality by small watershed data set. Conservation values were determined by SmartConservation (registered trademark) methodology. Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation\\xc2\\xae. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall aquatic resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau Ecoregion Ecoregion in Pennsylvania. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input aquatic resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",
