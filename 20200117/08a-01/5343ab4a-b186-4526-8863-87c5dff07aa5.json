  "dc_description_s": "Polygon coverage representing the predominant land use or land cover, as interpreted from aerial photography. Note: GDI delineated the land use boundaries using aerial photographs dated March 1993 and using a minimum mapping unit of one-half acre. ADR compiled land use polygons for all surface water features. NWI wetlands areas were identified using boundaries from a Quad-based wetland coverage; the wetland boundaries were then delineated using the aerial photography. Land uses are categorized using the Modified Anderson Level II classification system. Quality control check plots were produced at 1\"=250\\' scale the whole county. Planning Commission staff reviewed all of the check plots and forwarded comments and corrections to GDI. GDI made some of the corrections but did not make others, claiming that they were below the half-acre minimum mapping unit limit. Planning Commission staff has also made corrections where they have been found.",
