  "dc_description_s": "This dataset is a combination of both bike racks installed in 2008 as a result of Adopt-a-rack program and racks installed by converting parking meters by the Philadelphia Parking Authority. Those racks installed in 2008 as part of the City\\'s first Adopt-a-rack program were requested by civic and business associations who \"adopted\" them and promised to clear abandoned bikes, remove graffiti and maintain them if they were damaged. These bike racks are in the style of \\'staple\\' or \\'hoop\\' racks. The PPA racks are those mounted to the former parking meter posts. They are the green discs that have been installed through Center City and parts of University City. The PROJECT field defines the associated project of installation, either Adopt-a-rack or PPA. The STAND_ADD field is most appropriate for address locating or geocoding purposes. Please note the field NUM_RACKS represents the number of racks at a given address. Each record may represent more than one bike rack.",
