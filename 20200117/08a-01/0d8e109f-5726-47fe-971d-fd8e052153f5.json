Within DMAs, rehabilitation of cervids (deer, elk, and moose); the use or possession of cervid urine-based attractants in an outdoor setting; the removal of high-risk cervid parts; and the feeding of wild, free-ranging cervids are prohibited. Increased testing continues in these area to determine the distribution of the disease. Newly confirmed cases will alter the boudaries of DMAs as the Game Commission continues to manage the disease and minimize its affect on free ranging cervids.",
