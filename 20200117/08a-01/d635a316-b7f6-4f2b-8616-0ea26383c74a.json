This dataset includes the estimated subsurface extent within the Susquehanna River Basin of the Marcellus, Utica-Antes, Burket, Geneseo, Mandata, Middlesex, Needmore, and Rhinestreet Shales combined. This dataset was created using New York geology from the NYS Museum, NYS Geologic Survey, 1999 and Pennsylvania geology from PA DCNR, 2001. To depict potential natural gas shale area within the Susquehanna River Basin, only display formations with a \\'Yes\\' attribute for the field \"GAS_SHALE\".",
