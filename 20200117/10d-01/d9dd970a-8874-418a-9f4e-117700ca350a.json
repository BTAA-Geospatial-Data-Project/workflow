The layer is not a wetland classification but provides the wetland likelihood at a specific location. The rating was developed through a modelling process combining multiple GIS and remote sensing data sets including soil characteristics, elevation, existing wetland inventories, hydrographical extents and satellite imagery . Data available via download from the Digital Coast, either from customizable download in NOAA's Digital Access Viewer or FTP download by regions.",
