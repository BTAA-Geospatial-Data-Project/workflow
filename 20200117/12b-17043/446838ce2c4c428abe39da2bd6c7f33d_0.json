Depending on the species, ticks can transmit Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other illness to humans. DuPage County Health Department uses a suite of maps - Tick Reports, Bird Deaths, and Mosquito pools infected with West Nile virus to track the potential for human illness to increase due to mosquitoes and tics. These maps will be updated weekly throughout the season to promote public awareness and education.",
