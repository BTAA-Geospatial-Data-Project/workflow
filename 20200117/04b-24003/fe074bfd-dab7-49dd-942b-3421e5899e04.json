This data was collected using stereo imagery and orthoimagery. The imagery used was aquired as part of the Maryland Statewide Orthoimagery project. The 4 band, 6 inch pixel resolution imagery was flown in April 2014 and meets ASPRS Class 1 standards at map scale 1:1200 (1 = 100'). The minimum mapping unit for this layer is 100 square feet.\"",
