This DEM ('demgw930') is derived from the 7.5-minute DEMs published by the US Geological Survey (USGS). This DEM is an integer grid, with elevation units in meters relative to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29). The 7.5-minute DEMs have a 30-meter pixel cell size, or resolution. More current or detailed DEMs may also be available directly from the USGS. For more information, refer to the USGS DEM Fact Sheet:",
