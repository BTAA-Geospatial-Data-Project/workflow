  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents hydrography for Buffalo County, Wisconsin in 2013. It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Buffalo_LandUse_2013.gdb.[The cartographic process of heads-up digitizing was used in order to extract those regions identified as Forest / Woodlands, Rural / Open Lands, and Agriculture- General from aerial photography datasets. Data obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources was used to create the Recreation, Wetlands, and Surface Water categories, which are both visible in the current, and future land use maps.Much of the data used to derive the residential, commercial, and industrial categories came from local knowledge; however, building permits, zoning applications, and recorded documents were used when applicable. Buffalo County recognizes that this methodology of data collection and mapping process may result in potential inaccuracies of some land uses in the County. However, continual parcel mapping efforts by the County Treasurer\u2019s Office and the Land Information Office, as well as the evolution of this plan, should help identify and correct any errors that may have resulted from this initial mapping process.]",
