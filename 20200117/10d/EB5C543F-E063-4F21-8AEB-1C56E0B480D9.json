  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents land use for Manitowoc County, Wisconsin in 2009.[Land use inventory of Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. The inventory was conducted by Bay-Lake Regional Planning Commission (BLRPC) in 2007 - 2009, with the data set completed at the end of 2009. BLRPCommission staff used aerial photography and maps to delineate and note information on land uses in the field. All field work was undertaken with two staff people to provide verification and checking of land uses in the field. All structures appearing on aerial photography were inventoried as to type of use and noted on the photography or parcel/address map to determine location. New structures were noted on the photography or parcel/address map located relative to other visible landmarks along with type of use. Agricultural areas were inventoried as to the extent of current agricultural activities and delineated on the photography with notes on the use of the land. Undeveloped areas were inventoried as to the extent of the area covered and the general land cover. BLRPC used standard land use codes to note land uses on the photography or parcel/address map. For more information please contact the BLRPCommmission's GIS Department and ask for 'LAND USE INTERPRETATION & FIELD WORK RULES AND GUIDELINES, February 20, 2003.']",
