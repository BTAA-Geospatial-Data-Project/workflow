[The creation of the subsequent building footprint data was executed to capture the existing ground conditions at a specific point in time using Stereo Imagery for the purpose of GIS analysis. GIS is a system of computer software, hardware, and data that allows a user to manipulate, analyze, and present information that is tied to a spatial location. Sauk contracted with the Sanborn Map Company to execute a collection of various buildings types that meet contract requirements.]",
