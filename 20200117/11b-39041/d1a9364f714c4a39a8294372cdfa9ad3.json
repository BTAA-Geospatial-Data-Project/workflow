  "dc_description_s": "This data layer specifically contains the location of open ditches and subsurface drainage tiles.  This data layer was not created by the SWCD; however, we do currently maintain it.  In some instances, the data was created from historic hand-drawn records.  Because of this, the locations of some features are approximate.  The process that allows for landowners to petition the County Commissioners for drainage improvements (ORC 6131) has been around since the late-1800s.  The Drainage Maintenance provision of this law (ORC 6137) was enacted in 1957 and basically requires all projects done under the petition process to placed on the Drainage Maintenance program upon completion.  As such, many of the projects done under the petition process are not included on the maintenance program, and thus not included in our Drainage Maintenance GIS data layers.",
