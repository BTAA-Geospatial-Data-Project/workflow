  "dc_description_s": "This project was started as an effort to create a roster of historically accurate names for streams and channels in Delaware County.  Names were researched using a variety of sources.  Current aerial orthophotography was used for spatial accuracy.  All known names have been recorded with preference given to the earliest known and/or most legally-binding name.  Record sources used to create this layer include Historical Plat Records, USGS databases and topographic maps, 1866 Historical Township maps obtained from the Delaware County Historical Society, Delaware County Ditch Records, Delaware County Engineer's Office Bridge Records, and USDA NRCS project watershed records.",
