The area of acquisition is approximately 618 square miles (1600 square kilometers). This dataset consists of LiDAR LAS swath files and tiled LAS files. Tiled LAS files contain LiDAR point information which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Tiled LAS and derived data models are named according to a tiling scheme in accordance with the conventions of the U.S. National Grid, using the coordinates at the SW corner of the tile as the tile name.
