The data include all of Illinois and extend approximately nine miles beyond the state boundary. This image was derived from USGS 3 arc-second Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Some elevation data at the edges of individual DEM tiles were smoothed to remove edge-matching faults. This image was generated from the DEM dataset GISDB.IL_DEM_301FT_RAS, edition 1.0 (the ArcInfo grid version.)",
