Unlike such shapes in the Property_Poly layer, shapes in this layer lack associated tax accounts. Existing property lines and annotation in immediate proximity to the approved final plats are not changed due to additions to the Pending_Poly layer. Once changes due to a recorded plat of subdivision are completed in the Property_Poly layer, the corresponding shapes in the Pending_Poly layer are removed.",
