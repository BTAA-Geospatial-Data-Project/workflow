The District Council must determine that there has either been a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood or that a mistake was made either in the original zoning or the most recent sectional map amendment. The change or mistake finding does not apply to floating zones. Approval of a floating zone depends upon demonstrating conformance to required findings for approval of that zone as stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance.",
