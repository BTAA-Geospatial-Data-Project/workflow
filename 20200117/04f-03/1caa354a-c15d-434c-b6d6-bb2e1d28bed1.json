These standards benefit existing airports, area residents, future residents, nearby businesses, pilots, and airports operators. The purpose of the Aviation Policy Areas is to provide special regulations for the development of land which may be affected by operations at airports in order to encourage compatible land use around airports, mitigate nuisances and hazards associated with airport operations, and to protect people and structures in critical areas surrounding airports.",
