  "dc_description_s": "The Property_Info_Py layer dissolves properties from the Property Flattened\" layer with common tax account/ownership information (LDF records) creating many-to-one relationships between the LDF_Info records and Property_Info features, creating an ersatz \"Ownership\" map. For Zoning purposes, these boundaries are evaluated for frontage and side-yard provisions. Add and toggle the \"Property_Flattened\" layer on and off to see how 2 or more properties are combined to create one effective parcel.Each group of related LDF records is assigned one ACCOUNT number as the \"PRIMARY\" account (ACCT_PRIMARY) - usually the tax account with the highest valuation. Many numeric attributes from related LDF accounts are summed to the Property_Info features. (Dwelling Unit - DU, Valuation, Building Area, etc.) For non-numeric attributes from the related LDF accounts, the values from the Primary Account are used. (Owner, Ownership-Type, various Use Codes, etc.) In general, this produces satisfactory results since the account with the highest valuation is the predominate use and primary owner, BUT WHEN NON_NUMERIC DATA IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- YOU SHOULD ANALYZE THE PROPERTY_FLATTENED AND LDF TABLE for that data as it relates back to the Property_Info layer.Assessment Data used to derive this layer is current up to April 2018.\"",
