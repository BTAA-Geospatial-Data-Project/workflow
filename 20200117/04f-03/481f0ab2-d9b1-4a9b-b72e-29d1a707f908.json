Site features may include but are not limited to scenic, historic, environmental, and agricultural characteristics. A certified conservation sketch plan is required prior to the acceptance of a preliminary plan of subdivision for a conservation subdivision (24-152(e)). A conservation sketch plan is certified by the Planning Director for completeness and is valid for two years.",
