Areas 1, 2, and 3 coincide with the 2002 General Plan Tiers, where ESA 1 is the Developed Tier, ESA 2 is the Developing Tier, and ESA 3 is the Rural Tier. ESA 4 is the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Overlay Zone (CBCA). ESA 4 is further subdivided into three CBCA zones -- Resource Conservation, Limited Development, and Intense Development -- which also have implications for stream buffer requirements.",
