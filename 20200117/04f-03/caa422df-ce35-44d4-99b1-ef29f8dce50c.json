  "dc_description_s": "The Easement layer is a graphic representation of areas for construction, water management, utility, signage, and other areas in Prince George's County. These easements are found on recorded plats, but are not required by the Prince George's Planning board, or based on Subtitle 24, Subdivision Regulations of the County Code. This layer is a non-authoritative resource, indicating the presence of an easement based on information from the recorded final plat which would require additional research and consultation with Planning Department staff when analyzing and researching properties in Prince George's County.This layer is important when making long-range land use planning decisions, and also when on-site development activities occur. It is understood that this layer, for some time to come, will be incomplete, and, it may never be 100% complete simply because of the nature of easements and the fact that they can be established at different times in the process and through different means. The original easement data was recorded up to 2002, known in this layer as legacy data, when updates ceased until project continuation September 2010.",
