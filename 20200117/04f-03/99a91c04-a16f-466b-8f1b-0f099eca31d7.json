All remaining surfaces that do not fall under one of the 'Type' categories are classified as pervious. Impervious Surface features derived as a byproduct of the photogrammetric capture of planimetric features, for use in general mapping at a scale of 1:1200, using stereo imagery taken to satisfy creation of 6 inch ground pixel resolution orthophotography from March of 2009.",
