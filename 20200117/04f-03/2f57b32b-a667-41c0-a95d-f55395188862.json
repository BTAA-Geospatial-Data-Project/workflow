  "dc_description_s": "This data layer was created by Prince George's Planning staff as cy copying and updating existing 1988 CBCA annotation. The layer contains labels for the new critical area boundary and corresponding designations derived from shoreline and wetlands digitized from 2007/08 aerial imagery and CIR. A 1000' buffer of the shorline and wetlands generated the proposed critical area boundary. Critical area designations (IDA, LDA, RCA, - Prince George's Planning chnaged the designations to I-D-O, L-D-O, and R-C-O to correspond with local zoning values) were pulled from the current designation layer and fit to the new boundary. Extensive discussions with County officials and Critical Area Commission resulted in a complete review of designations. Planning Department staff edits: changed designation types to correspond with Planning Department Zoning values; added fields for the legislation title and date enacting the area.",
