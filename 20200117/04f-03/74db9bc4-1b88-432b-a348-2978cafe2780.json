  "dc_description_s": "The Area of Primary Concern represents an area potentially visible from George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate (East Lawn), with the removal of forest cover and construction of buildings 36 feet high. The original analysis was performed by EDAW, Inc. in 1991 using GIS visual simulation, and was adjusted in 2007 by Michael G. Clarke, AICP using ArcView and 1:24,000 USGS topographic maps, enhanced by National Geographic (TOPO series). The accuracy of the Area of Primary Concern diminishes as the distance increases from Mt. Vernon. Field verification is required to confirm whether specific locations are within Mt. Vernon's viewshed.",
