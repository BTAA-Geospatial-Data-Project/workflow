Canals, water cooling channels, and streams that run below elevated structures or underground are shown with a hidden feature code. Single line streams are those that are less than 20 feet in width. Centerlines of streams greater than 20 feet in width are shown with a separate feature code. Dams in this layer include those smaller ones found in creeks. This data was captured for use in general mapping at a scale of 1:1200.",
