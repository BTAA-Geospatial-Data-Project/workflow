The new feature class was created using existing Multifamily address data of approximately 115,000 addresses, which was maintained and provided the Commission. The existing Multifamily addresses were geocoded using a combination of the Commission\u2019s PGAtlas.com Composite Geocoder and manual address identification and update. This Technical Memorandum documents the process that was used to geocode the existing Multifamily addresses to generate the new Multifamily Point Feature Class.",
