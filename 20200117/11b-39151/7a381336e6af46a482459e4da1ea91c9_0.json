  "dc_description_s": "This layer depicts generalized land uses to suit the needs of the Stark County Regional Planning Commission (SCRPC). The Stark County Auditor Office (SCAO) maintains the county's parcel layer which includes a land use field under the guise of the Department of Tax Equalization (DTE). The DTE code is included as part of the real property information maintained by SCAO. SCRPC required a generalized land use layer that did not need to meet DTE specifications. Stark County GIS (SCGIS) generalized land use types by grouping like-DTE codes. The codes are generalized in broad categories like residential, industrial, and vacant land. These codes are for land use and do not depict land cover. ",
