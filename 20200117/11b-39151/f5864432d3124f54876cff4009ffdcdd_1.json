  "dc_description_s": "Corner monuments for sections and some quarter-sections within Stark County, Ohio. The locations of these monuments were collected and positioned by the Stark County Engineer (SCE). The attribute table includes detailed information on the spatial location of each point. The State of Ohio was subdivided using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The PLSS initially subdivided lands into townships, which were numbered using a grid system. Townships were numbered horizontally and cross-referenced with vertical numbers referred to as the range. Each township was further divided into one-mile sections, which were subsequently divided into quarter-sections. The corners of these sections were marked with permanent monuments. Monuments were also included for some quarter-sections and other important boundaries. ",
