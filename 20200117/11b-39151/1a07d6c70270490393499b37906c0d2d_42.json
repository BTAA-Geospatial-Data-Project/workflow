  "dc_description_s": "A roadside ditch is any channel or depression dug in the ground used to transfer stormwater runoff. The ditches in this layer should be distinguished from dedicated off-road ditches. The features in this layer are part of a combined stormwater layer maintained by the Stark County Engineer (SCE) and Stark County Regional Planning Commission (SCRPC). It only includes features owned and maintained by the County Engineer, as well as features located in the census-designated urbanized areas of Stark County's townships - which were collected by SCRPC. For a more expansive inventory of stormwater features in the county, use the Stark County Stormwater Systems layer on ArcGIS Online.",
