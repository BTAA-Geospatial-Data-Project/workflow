  "dc_description_s": "The neighborhood boundaries in this layer are determined by the Stark County Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA system). Each neighborhood has a unique ID that can be found in the attribute data. The ID is a string with four sets of numbers; e.g. 001-02-03-04. The first three-digit set - 001 in the example - is the tax district. The second set - 02 in the example - is the sub-market area, which is provides a more specific location within a market. An example would be NW Canton. The third set - 03 in the example - is based on the elementary school. The fourth set - 04 in the example - is reserved for individual local neighborhoods.",
