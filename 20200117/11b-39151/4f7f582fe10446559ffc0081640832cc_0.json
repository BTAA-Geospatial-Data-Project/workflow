  "dc_description_s": "This layer identifies routes for bicyclists based on their relative experience. In 2015, the Stark County Regional Planning Commission (SCRPC) used available transportation data with input from the Stark County Bicycle Club to create a countywide map for bicyclists. SCRPC heavily weighted traffic volume, speed limit, and the number of lanes to determine which routes for more or less suitable for different levels of biking experience. Their formula also considered things like turn lanes and dedicated bike lanes. The end product was dubbed Ride Stark, and was used to create disputable paper maps, as well as an interactive online map that can be viewed here.For off-limit roadways for bicyclists in Stark County, see Ride Stark - Off-Limit Roadways.For on-road bike lanes in Stark County, see Ride Stark - Dedicated Bike Lanes.",
