This layer was initially developed so that police, fire, and EMS would be able to identify the closest street intersection for emergency calls. Within the attribute table, you will find the names for the intersecting streets; the primary and secondary streets are the only attributes that are populated. This data is a work in progress and will be updated periodically as new streets are added to our data. It is planned for each street intersection point to be eventually filled out for the whole county.",
