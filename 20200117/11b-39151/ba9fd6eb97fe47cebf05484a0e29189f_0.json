  "dc_description_s": "This parcel polygon layer is the primary parcel layer used with Stark County, Ohio. The parcel boundaries are maintained by the Stark County Auditor Office (SCAO) Tax Map Department. The SCAO uses a Computer-Assisted mass Appraisal (CAMA) database to maintain and store data on properties throughout the county. This data includes market valuations, property owners and addresses, and a variety of other information. This layer combines the parcel boundaries and the CAMA data using a SQL view. There are a number of other layers publicly-available by the county that include other combinations of parcel boundaries and background attribute data.For foreclosure data, see Historic Foreclosures.For land bank properties, see Land Bank Parcels.For the market values of properties, see Market Values.For historic parcel sales, see Parcel Sales.",
