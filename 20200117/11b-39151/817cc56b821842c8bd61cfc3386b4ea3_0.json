  "dc_description_s": "This layer provides quarter-section boundaries for the Stark County tax map. The State of Ohio was subdivided using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The PLSS initially subdivided lands into townships, which were numbered using a grid system. Townships were numbered horizontally and cross-referenced with vertical numbers referred to as the range. Each township was further divided into one-mile sections, which were subsequently divided into quarter-sections. This layer does not reflect the initial PLSS boundaries. It respects current jurisdictional boundaries and reflects boundaries within Stark County's cities and villages as well. Each quarter section includes tax district information. ",
