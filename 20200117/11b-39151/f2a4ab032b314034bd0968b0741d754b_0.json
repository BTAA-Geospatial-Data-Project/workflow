The buildings in this layer were automatically generated (see below).Stark County utilizes oblique aerial imagery provided by Pictometry. Pictometry flies regularly to provide aerial imagery and oblique aerial imagery. Pictometry also offers LiDAR products, including building footprints. The features in this layer were derived from LiDAR data collected in a 2015 flyover of the county. These building footprints were extracted based on specific pixel signatures found in that 3D data. This layer is not updated and contains buildings captured only during that 2015 flight.",
