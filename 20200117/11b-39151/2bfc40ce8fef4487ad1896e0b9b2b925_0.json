The data was download in May, 2019, from the NRCS GeoSpatialDataGateway and only sections within the extent of the county boundary were included in this layer. The State of Ohio was subdivided using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The PLSS initially subdivided lands into townships, which were numbered using a grid system. Townships were numbered horizontally and cross-referenced with vertical numbers referred to as the range. Each township was further divided into one-mile sections, which were subsequently divided into quarter-sections.",
