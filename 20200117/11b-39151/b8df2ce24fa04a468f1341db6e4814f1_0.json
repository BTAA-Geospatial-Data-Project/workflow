  "dc_description_s": "A point depiction of property sales that occurred in Stark County, Ohio. The Stark County Auditor's Office (SCAO) maintains records of property sales using a Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) Database. Each morning, the Stark County parcel layer is converted to a point layer, which is then combined with sales records from the CAMA database in a SQL view. A new view is created every morning through a combination of python scripts and SQL stored procedures. The data always reflects the most-recent information available from the previous day for both sources. For property sales from this decade only, or for sales depicted as parcel polygons, see Property Sales (2010-present).",
