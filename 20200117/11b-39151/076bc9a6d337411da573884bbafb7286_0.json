The Stark County Auditor's Office (SCAO) maintains records of property sales using a Computer-Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) Database. This layer is a SQL view combining the sales records from the CAMA database with the Stark County parcel layer. A new view is created every morning through a combination of python scripts and SQL stored procedures. The data always reflects the most-recent information available from the previous day for both sources. For property sales that occurred prior to 2010, or for sales depicted as points, see Historic Property Sales.",
