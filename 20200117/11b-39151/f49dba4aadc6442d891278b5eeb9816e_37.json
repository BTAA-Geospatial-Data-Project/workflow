  "dc_description_s": "A stormwater discharge point where stormwater runoff leaves a storm sewer system and enters a body of water. This can be a pipe or a ditch. A discharge point is considered an outfall under NPDES monitoring requirements where water discharges from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or other public system into a public water (waterways of America). This layer also includes points where stormwater passes between municipal boundaries (MS4 Transition in the attribute table) and other outlets (Standard Outlet or Unknown in the attribute table) that are not considered outfalls under the NPDES criteria. The features in this layer are part of a combined stormwater layer maintained by the Stark County Engineer (SCE) and Stark County Regional Planning Commission (SCRPC). It only includes features owned and maintained by the County Engineer, as well as features located in the census-designated urbanized areas of Stark County's townships - which were collected by SCRPC. For a more expansive inventory of stormwater features in the county, use the Stark County Stormwater Systems layer on ArcGIS Online.",
