This is a point layer featuring the mile marker locations on the highways throughout the county. The data was last updated in 2014 and is not maintained by SCGIS. Mile markers on highways provide a more precise location during emergencies. Those seeking emergency assistance on a highway can report to dispatchers the closest mile marker and help get a faster response. ",
