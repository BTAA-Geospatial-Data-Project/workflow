The County Regional Planning Commission (RPC), Auditor, and Emergency Management Agency (EMA) all have a stake in the addressing process. Addresses in the county's townships are assigned by RPC and sent to the GIS Department to be updated. Addresses in the county's municipalities are assigned by each community and sent to either EMA or the GIS Department to be updated. This layer is updated continuously as new addresses or address changes are sent to the GIS Department. The attribute table contains information on location, structure type, and numerous other fields.
