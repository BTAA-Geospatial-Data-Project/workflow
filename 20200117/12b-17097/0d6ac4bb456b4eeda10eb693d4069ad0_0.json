These address points were developed for a myriad of uses including general public geocoding in Lake County web sites and NG-911 emergency dispatch. All addresses are reviewed on a monthly basis against the United States Post Office delivery database to ensure that they are still active. New addresses are added at this time or earlier if they are made known to Lake County GIS by local data partners. Attributes DiscrpAgID through Elev reflect the NENA NG-911 / State of Illinois GIS Data model. Additional local data fields have also been included.
