  "dc_description_s": "These building outlines were traced from aerial photography taken between April 13 and April 26, 2002 and then updated from successive years of photography. The most recent aerial photography was flown between April 18 and April 26, 2014. This dataset should meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product. All the enclosed structures in Lake County with an area larger than 100 square feet as of April 2014 should be represented in this coverage. It should also be noted that a single polygon in this dataset could be composed of many structures that share walls or are otherwise touching. For example, a shopping mall may be captured as one polygon. Note that the roof area boundary is often not identical to the building footprint at ground level. Contributors to this dataset include: Municipal GIS Partners, Inc., Village of Gurnee, Village of Vernon Hills.",
