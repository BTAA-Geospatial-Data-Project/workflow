See the Lake County Soils Documentation for additional information -- including an explanation of data fields.This product includes the United States Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service 2004 Soil Survey data and related information. An intergovernmental funding agreement between the USDA-NRCS, the State of Illinois Department of Agriculture and Lake County made this product possible. This soil information is referred to as SSURGO by NRCS. The spatial (soil polygons) and tabular (physical and chemical properties) data for all soil survey areas are available free from the Web Soil Survey website. Helpful information about soils can be found through the NRCS Illinois website. The McHenry-Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District staff can also provide assistance with questions related to soils.",
