  "dc_description_s": "Download In State Plane Projection Here. Boundaries of designated high quality ADID wetlands established as a result of a formal process under the direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Part 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the USEPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers  to identify in advance of specific permit requests aquatic sites which  will be considered as areas generally unsuitable for disposal of dredged  or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or  ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally  unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill  in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is  advisory not regulatory.          An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in  advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be  consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably  request permit denial.          ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed  planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural  resource studies and other purposes.          The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented  in the publication entitled Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake  County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992 which is included in  this download.          Boundaries were delineated by the ADID project team on  orthophotograph background with an intended usage scale of 1 = 400', a  scale ratio of 1:4800.",
