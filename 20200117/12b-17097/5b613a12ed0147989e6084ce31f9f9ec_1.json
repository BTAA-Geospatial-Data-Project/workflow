  "dc_description_s": "These street centerlines were developed for a myriad of uses including E-911, as a cartographic base, and for use in spatial analysis. This coverage should include all public and selected private roads within Lake County, Illinois. Roads are initially entered using recorded documents and then later adjusted using current aerial photography. This dataset should satisfy National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product. These centerlines have been provided to the United States Census Bureau and were used to conflate the TIGER road features for Lake County. The Census Bureau evaluated these centerlines and, based on field survey of 109 intersections, determined that there is a 95% confidence level that the coordinate positions in the centerline dataset fall within 1.9 meters of their true ground position. The fields PRE_DIR, ST_NAME, ST_TYPE and SUF_DIR are formatted according to United States Postal Service standards. Update Frequency: This dataset is updated on a weekly basis.",
