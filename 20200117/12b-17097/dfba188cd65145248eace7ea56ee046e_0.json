  "dc_description_s": "Download In State Plane Projection Here. This dataset represents the linear water features (for example, dams,  culverts, and streams) and the outer boundary of the water feature  areas (for example, lakes and ponds) of Lake County, Illinois. The  features in the dataset include: dams, culverts, local drainage; and the  outer boundary of lakes, ponds, detention/retention basins,  river/streams/creeks greater than five feet wide, and islands.          The data has not been field verified and errors and/or omissions may be present.          The names used for the water bodies were collected from a  number of sources including: existing datasets, historic maps and/or  atlases, US Geologic Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS),  current and historical USGS topographic quadrangle maps, local  publications on place names within the county, and platted subdivisions.          The dataset was traced from aerial photography captured  between April 13 and April 26, 2002. The water features were compiled  using softcopy analytical stereoplotters. This dataset should meet  National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product and it is  georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83  HARN horizontal datum.",
