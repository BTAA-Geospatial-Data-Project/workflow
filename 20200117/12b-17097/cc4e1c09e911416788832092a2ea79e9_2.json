  "dc_description_s": "This Trails theme is the result of a collaborative effort by the Lake County Division of Transportation, the Lake County Forest Preserve District, the municipalities of Gurnee, Highland Park, Lake Forest, Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Vernon Hills, and Waukegan among others, and the GIS Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology. Note that the trails in this theme are actually constructed, open, in-use trails. This theme does not include any future trail plans or trails under new construction. In addition, trail loops not greater than around 1000 ft were not included (i.e. to avoid isolated playgrounds). All the geometry has been verified to match the 2014 aerials as much as possible but some areas have been drawn with older aerials when the 2014 tree cover was too dense. Therefore the spatial reference is now in NAD83(NSRS2007) vs HARN to match the 2014 aerials. The intended usage scale for this theme is 1 = 100' or a scale ratio of 1:1200. This specification derives from the scale of the orthophotography used as a reference for the trail line features, for trails not mapped through field GPS data gathering. The bike, horse, snowmobile, and walking usage types were chosen since we have the most complete information on them. They are blank when information is not available. The surface types are photo interpreted and have not been field verified.Update Frequency:This dataset is updated on a weekly basis.",
