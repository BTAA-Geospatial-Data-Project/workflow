  "dc_description_s": "This feature class represents the petitioned water master plan areas that have been introduced in previous years through cycle amendments within Baltimore County. Unlike the WHisMasterPlan feature class, this feature class does not distinguish between different cycle amendment petitions and only reflects the most current water master plan designation.The water master plan geodatabase includes a feature data set (WaterMasterPlan) containing three feature classes: WCurMasterPlan, WaterCombined and WHisMasterPlan. The feature classes participate in a topology (tWaterMasterPlan). The WCurMasterPlan feature class represents the petitions for the current cycle. The WaterCombined represents the current master plan designation within the county. The WHisMasterPlan contains all of the petitions areas from all cycles. The geodatabase includes relationship classes that associate related table containing information on assessments, councilmanic districts, election districts, lineage (feature level metadata), plan map, recommendations and zoning designations.",
