The tiles are 15,000 feet (E-W) by 10,000 feet (N-S) and consist of 100 position sheet grid tiles. This grid was used to help locate the area or region for a project. One position sheet can only cover an area of 34 acres of land, while one key sheet can cover an area of 3444 acres. The grid was in use in Baltimore County, Maryland until 1999 and continues to be referenced in business data.",
