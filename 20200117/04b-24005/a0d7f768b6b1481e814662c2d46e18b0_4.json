  "dc_description_s": "Census designated places (CDPs) are closely settled, named, unincorporated communities that generally contain a mixture of residential, commercial, and retail areas similar to those found in incorporated places of similar sizes. The Census Bureau works with local participants to delineate boundaries for CDPs. By defining CDPs, the Census Bureau can tabulate and disseminate data for localities that otherwise would not be identified as places in the decennial census data products.    Each CDP will contain an identifiable core encompassing the area that is associated strongly with the CDP name and contains the majority of the CDP's population, housing, commercial structures, and economic activity. A CDP must comprise a reasonably compact and continuous land area internally accessible to all points by road. (Except where parts of a CDP are separated by a narrow corridor of incorporated territory, or where the topography or geographic patterns of settlement are not compact, but are irregularly shaped.) A CDP may not be located partially or entirely within an incorporated place or another CDP. A CDP encompasses the surrounding closely settled territory associated with the place name. The Census Bureau does not intend for a CDP to be an apartment complex or residential subdivision in densely settled areas or simply a crossroads in rural areas.    There are no minimum or maximum population thresholds for recognition as a CDP. This represents a substantial change from all prior CDP criteria.",
