This data set shows the Baltimore County portion of the State-defined Maryland 8-digit watersheds*. There are 14 major watersheds in Baltimore County. The data was interpreted from Baltimore County's 1953 topographic maps and was delineated at 1:2400 scale. *These features are not identical to the State-defined Maryland 8-digit watersheds. The features were refined using 1953 topographic data and a larger delineation scale.",
