  "dc_description_s": "The Sub Watershed data set contains areas of land that contribute runoff and groundwater into a specific stream system. Each feature in this data set represents the drainage basin for a single named stream or waterbody. The drainage basins were delineated from Baltimore County's 1953 topographic maps at 1:2400 scale. Stream names were extensively researched by S. Hank Grose. Stream name sources included 1970-1990 state highway maps and various historic maps.",
