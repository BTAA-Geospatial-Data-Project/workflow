Franklin County Auditor - Local Government Information Model - Reference Data Feature Class - Water BodiesThis layer contains polygon features of water bodies large enough to identify on 6 inch aerial photography. This layer was originally derived from the 2011 OSIP LiDAR collection but is updated as part of the planametic (base map) mapping conducted by the Auditor's office. This layer follows ERSI's Local Government Information Model (LGIM) schema and has been edited to meet the needs of the Franklin County Auditor and our customers.",
