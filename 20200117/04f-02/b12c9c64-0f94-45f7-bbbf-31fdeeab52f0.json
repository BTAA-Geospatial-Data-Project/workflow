  "dc_description_s": "This is a geodatabase of Purple Line Transitway, Proposed Features, Maryland Transit Administration: Montgomery County, Maryland, 2017 The Purple Line is a proposed 16-mile Light Rail Transit (LRT) line connecting Bethesda to New Carrollton. There are ten stations in Montgomery County, including Bethesda, Connecticut Avenue, Lyttonsville, Woodside, Silver Spring Transit Center, Silver Spring Library, Dale Drive, Manchester Place, Long Branch, and Piney Branch Road. An eleventh station at Takoma/Langley Crossroads is just outside of Montgomery County, but will be used by Montgomery County residents. The light rail line operates partially in exclusive right-of-way (the Georgetown Branch and CSX corridor), partially in the dedicated lanes in the roadway (Arliss Street, Piney Branch Road, and University Blvd), and partially in shared lanes (Bonifant Street, Wayne Avenue)[1]. MTA forecasts that there will be 74,160 daily boardings of the Purple Line in 2040[2]. Access to the stations will largely be by walking, bicycling, and transit. No new parking facilities will be constructed by the project, and many of the stations will have no public parking facilities. The Purple Line will be jointly funded by the federal government and State of Maryland, with some financing of the capital cost provided by the private sector. It will be designed, built, operated, and maintained by a concessionaire as part of a Public-Private Partnership.
