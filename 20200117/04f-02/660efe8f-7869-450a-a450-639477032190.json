  "dc_description_s": "Every individual property in Montgomery County, MD has a water category and a sewer category. In order to provide for an orderly extension of community public water and sewer service, State regulations (COMAR 26.03.01.04) have established category designations for water and sewer service areas. These categories identify those areas approved or proposed for community service and those areas where development will depend on individual systems. In addition, some areas of the county are noted for special service conditions or restrictions, including those areas where the county has approved the use of multi-use systems. The water and sewer data is updated on an ongoing basis as amendments are made to the County's Comprehensive Water Supply and Sewerage Systems Plan.",
