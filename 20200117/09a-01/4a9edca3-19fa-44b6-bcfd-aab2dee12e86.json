The data represented in this layer is strictly a visual aide and a best interpretation of the legally approved Electric Service Territories as ruled by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC). These data are not legally binding or necessarily fully representative of the legal rulings. These data were provided by personnel of the IURC on May 21, 2007, and subsequently updated on February 19, 2014, June 11, 2014, August 6, 2014, April 14, 2015, May 2, 2016, November 23, 2016, and June 29, 2017.",
