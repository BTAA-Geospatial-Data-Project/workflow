  "dc_description_s": "COAL_MINE_MINED_OUT_DANVILLE_IN_2010 is a polygon-based ESRI ArcGIS shapefile that shows the location and extent of the mined-out areas in the Danville Coal Member in the coal region of west-central and southwestern Indiana. COAL_MINE_MINED_OUT_DANVILLE_IN_2010 includes mine locations from documented surface and underground mines that operated in Indiana since the late 1800s. COAL_MINE_MINED_OUT_DANVILLE_IN_2010 is attributed to allow the mine polygons to be differentiated based on mine number, county name, and mine type (surface or underground).",
