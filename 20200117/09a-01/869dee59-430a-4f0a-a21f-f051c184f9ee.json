COAL_MINE_SURFACE_DNR_IN.SHP is attributed with mine number (IDNR), map number (IDNR), start dates, and end dates.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR, Division of Reclamation, for the source point feature class named \"SURFACE_AFFECTED\":  \"Coal_Mine_Surface_DNR_IN is a polygon-based ESRI ArcGIS shapefile that shows the location and extent of surface coal mines in the coal region of west-central and southwestern Indiana. Coal_Mine_Surface_DNR_IN includes mine locations from documented surface mines that operated in Indiana since the late 1800s. Coal_Mine_Surface_DNR_IN is attributed to allow the mine polygons to be differentiated based on mine number, source information, and dates of mining.",
