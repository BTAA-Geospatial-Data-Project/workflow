Wing dams are rock and brush structures extending from the bank toward the navigation channel to concentrate flow in the navigation channel. Closing dams are rock and brush structures extending across secondary channels to concentrate flow in the main channel. Many closing dams are located at the upriver entrance to secondary channels, while others are located farther downriver within secondary channels.",
