There is no tax rate for TIF districts. Instead, TIFs receive money based on tax rates generated by other districts' tax levies. Money is allocated to the TIF based on the composite tax rate for properties in the TIF and the incremental value of properties in that TIF (when compared to values when the TIF was established).",
