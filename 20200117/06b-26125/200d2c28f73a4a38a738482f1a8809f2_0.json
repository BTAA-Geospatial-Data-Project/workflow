Simplified vector dataset derived from imagery of lights at night from the SNPP (Suomi National Polar Partnership) satellite flown by NASA and NOAA.VIIRS Day/Night Band Imagery acquired 11/5/2015 at about 3:30 AM Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Data Records from Suomi NPP 11/05/201508:27:00.3 UTC - 08:41:11.8 UTC Orbit Number: 20842 SNPP is the Suomi National Polar Partnership satellite flown by NASA and NOAA. It is the next generation polar orbiting satellite, collecting both daytime and nighttime data worldwide each day. The primary imager on SNPP is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The source data are produced in HDF5 format and are available through NOAA's CLASS archive.
