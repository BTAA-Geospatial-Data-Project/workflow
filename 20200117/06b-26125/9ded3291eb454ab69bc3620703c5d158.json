  "dc_description_s": "The Classified Point Cloud (LAS) for the 2017 Michigan LiDAR project covering approximately 907 square miles, covering Oakland County. LAS data products are suitable for 1 foot contour generation. USGS LiDAR Base Specification 1.2, QL 2.19.6 cm NVA. This data is for planning purposes only and should not be used for legal or cadastral purposes. Any conclusions drawn from analysis of this information are not the responsibility of Sanborn Map Company. Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since this dataset was collected and some parts of this dataset may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Users should not use these data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations. This service is best used directly within ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro. If the raw LiDAR points are needed, use these clients to extract project area size portions. Due to the density of the data, downloading the entire County from this service is not possible. For further questions, contact the Oakland County Service Center at 248-858-8812.",
