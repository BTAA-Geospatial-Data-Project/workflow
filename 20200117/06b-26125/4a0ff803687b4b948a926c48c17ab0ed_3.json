The downloaded SSURGO data included an ArcGIS Shapefile of the soil type features for Oakland County, tabular data in text file format, and an empty pre-formatted Microsoft Access database containing queries, macros and reports. The Shapefile was intially projected in State Plane Michigan South Meters NAD 83, but was then reprojected by Oakland County staff to State Plane Michigan South International Feet NAD 83. The USDA-NRCS provided instructions for automatically importing the tabular text files into the Microsoft Access database. The key attribute of this feature class is the map unit key (MUSYM field), which relates the polygon features to the SoilAttribute table stored within SDE. The related SoilAttribute table in SDE contains some of the tabular data which was initially imported into the aforementioned Microsoft Access database.",
