Parts of Route 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 21, 64, 515 and all of Route 54, the A Line, the METRO Blue Line and the METRO Green Line offer High-Frequency service. Service on Route 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 21, 64 and 515 continues outside of the areas shown, but operates less frequently. The line work for the dataset was derived from the NCompass Technologies Street Centerline.",
