Forests in much, but not all, of northern Minnesota were surveyed, as well as far southeastern Minnesota. Only forest disturbances were mapped if they were occurring at the time of the flight, and flights primarily occurred in late June and July. The following were the most common disturbers, listed from largest area disturbed to smallest area disturbed: spruce budworm, eastern larch beetle, wind, larch casebearer, aspen decline, forest tent caterpillar, flooding, emerald ash borer, jack pine budworm, and twolined chestnut borer.",
