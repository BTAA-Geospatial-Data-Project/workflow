  "dc_description_s": "The State of Minnesota issues peat leases on state-owned and state-administered fee surface interests. These layers are of active or historic State peat leases, administered by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, mapped to the PLS forty and government lot. When there is no match to the PLS forty or government lot in the PLS40 layer, a record is then matched to the PLS section layer. These layers merge the DNR Control Point Generated PLS layer (PLS40) with land records stored in the DNR's Land Record System (LRS) in Oracle. The data are limited to a forty, government lot, or section level representation. Therefore, any state peat leases that are less than a forty, government lot, or section, are represented by the entire forty, government lot, or section.   There are four layers included in this geodatabase:  1) active (closed or completed) peat leases mapped to the PLS forty or government lot,  2) dissolved active peat leases, where the peat lease areas have been merged based on specific attributes, such as the lease number (i.e., the DNRTRNXNUM field), type of lease, start and expiration dates, but not the attributes to the PLS forty and government lot,  3) historic peat leases that have ended,and  4) dissolved peat leases, where the peat lease areas have been merged based on specific attributes, such as the lease number (i.e., the DNRTRNXNUM field), type of lease, start and expiration and termination dates, but not the attributes to the PLS forty and government lot.   The names for the layers are active_peatleases, active_peatleases_dissolved, historic_peatleases, and historic_peatleases_dissolved.",
