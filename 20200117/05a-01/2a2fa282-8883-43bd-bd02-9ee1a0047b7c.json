  "dc_description_s": "One or more lanes on the left or right side of the though lanes that permit vehicles to enter, exit or pass traffic. A designated area on the left or right side of a roadway that allows for vehicles to park. The number of through lanes carrying through traffic in the off-peak period. Lanes that allow traffic to make a left or right turn at an intersection or to a side-road. Turn lanes are controlled by road signs and/or pavement markings that show the direction of travel from the lane. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one ending in Non Measured which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. Check other metadata records in this package for more information on Roadway lane Information.",
