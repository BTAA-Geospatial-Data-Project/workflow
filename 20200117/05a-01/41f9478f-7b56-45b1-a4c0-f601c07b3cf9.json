  "dc_description_s": "Indicates if there are curbs present on a given route segment (Right, Left, or Both). A stabilized shoulder on the left and right of the roadway, usually made of concrete or bituminous that serves as a emergency stopping lane. An unsterilized shoulder on the left and right of the roadway, usually made of gravel or dirt that serves as a emergency stopping lane. MnDOT LRS data files will come in two versions, one saying Non Measured in the tittle which does not contain calibrations. These files are good for reference material. The other version without the Non Measured in the tittle has calibrations and can be used to run linear events or extract measures. These versions require contacting MnDOT to retrieve. The calibrations in them are not compatible with older Transportation Information System/GIS BaseMap measures. Check other metadata records in this package for more information on curbs and shoulders",
