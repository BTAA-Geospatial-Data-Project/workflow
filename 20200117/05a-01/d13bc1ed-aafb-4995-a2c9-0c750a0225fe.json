  "dc_description_s": "This Minnesota NLCD layer is derived from the full NLCD dataset. The national raster is clipped and projected to UTM Zone 15N. For the original dataset in Albers Equal Area Conic, refer to the NLCD webpage: http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd01_data.php   The National Land Cover Database 2001 for Minnesota was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004).  Three layers are included: - Land Cover (mapping zones 31-51) - Imperviousness Surface (mapping zones 39, 40-42, and 50-51) - Tree Canopy (mapping zones 39-42, 50-51)",
