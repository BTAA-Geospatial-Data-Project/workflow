AMAs are established to <i>\"protect, develop and manage lakes, rivers, streams, and adjacent wetlands and lands that are critical for fish and other aquatic life for water quality, and for their intrinsic biological value, public fishing, or other compatible outdoor recreational uses.\"</i>  (MN Statutes 86A Subd. 14)  Some features in this layer are hyperlinked to the scanned county deed documents that describe the original acquisitions. Use ArcMap's <i>Hyperlink Tool (yellow lightning bolt)</i>  to access deed documents.
