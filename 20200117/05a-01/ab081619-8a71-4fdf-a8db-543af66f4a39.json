  "dc_description_s": "This is the MnDOT user-accepted version of the state boundary. It is a composite of all of the county boundaries, as accepted by MnDOT for general purpose use. This boundary represents a pre-1947 state boundary as it does not recognize the 1947 states compact signed between Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota, which defined the boundary/boundaries within Lake Superior. This boundary measures approximately 84,365 square miles, and excludes the portion of Lake Superior that is legally defined as part of the state of Minnesota. This medium-scale (nominally 1:24,000) dataset represents the boundaries of Cities in Minnesota. It is derived from CTU dataset where the feature type is a City (does not include townships or unorganized territories). The Minnesota Geospatial Information Office created the initial CTU dataset by updating a municipal boundary file maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). Update information was gathered primarily from annexation and detachment records maintained by the Office of Administrative Hearings, Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit. MnDOT has maintained the file since 2014. This medium-scale (nominally 1:24,000) dataset represents the boundaries of cities, townships, and unorganized territories (CTUs) in Minnesota.

MnDOT has maintained the file since 2014. This dataset represents the county boundaries, as recognized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. There are 87 counties in Minnesota. The adjusted urban boundaries from the 2010 U.S. census. Jurisdictional crosswalk is a combination of data from federal sources and legacy MnDOT data. It creates a crosswalk or translation between various ID systems for city, township, and unorganized territories within the State of Minnesota. Tribal Government boundaries is a layer that contains the Minnesota interpretation of the federally recognized tribal boundaries within Minnesota. For the Federal interpretation see the US senses TIGER files. Check other metadata records in this package for more information on boundaries of jurisdictions.",
