  "dc_description_s": "This suite of data is a collection of layers that communicate the locations of child care centers and family child care in Minnesota. It was created by downloading licensing information from the MN Department of Human Services (DHS), and geocoding the addresses of the resulting records. Note: while the DHS licensing download also includes a license type of \"Certified Child Care Center\", no records resulted from a search of that license type at the time of this dataset's creation. Thus, that license type is not included in this collection. Follow the links below to the individual metadata pages for each layer:<a href=\"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/econ_child_care/metadata/childCareCenters.html\">Child Care Centers</a> - Programs licensed to provide care to children for less than 24 hours a day in a commercial setting.<a href=\"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mngeo/econ_child_care/metadata/familyChildCare.html\">Family Child Care</a> - Programs licensed to provide care to children for less than 24 hours a day, typically in the provider\u2019s home or a local space, including a church.",
