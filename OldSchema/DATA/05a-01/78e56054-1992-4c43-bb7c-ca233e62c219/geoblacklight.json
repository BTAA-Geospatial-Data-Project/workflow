  "dc_description_s": "This data set contains natural color imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition.  The source files are 2 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within 10 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP). The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.  This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county. MrSID compression, with mosaic option, was used. Target values for the compression ratio are (15:1) and MrSID Generation 3.  (Note: MnGeo created this metadata record using information from Farm Service Agency metadata. Each county file is accompanied by the original FSA metadata for that county.)",
