  "dc_description_s": "This is a feature class of <b>measured stream routes</b> and is a core feature class within the <a href=\"../../water_dnr_hydrography/metadata/dnr_hydrography_dataset.html \"><b>DNR Hydrography Dataset</b>.</a>  A \"route\" is an ESRI linear feature type created through a process called <i>Dynamic Segmentation</i>.  Each stream route is labeled with a unique stream ID (i.e., DNR Fisheries Kittle Number) and has mile measures extending from the stream mouth (FROM_MEAS, mile=0) to headwaters (TO_MEAS, mile=total stream length).  DNR Kittle Numbers follow a drainage-branching format (e.g., X-000-000-000...) and are assigned to all Fisheries-managed streams (see attribute field [VALID] = 'Y').  Additional streams have been labeled with \"dummy\" kittle numbers in order to provide a unique ID (VALID = 'N').  For more information about the DNR Kittle Number stream identification system, see the <b>Fisheries Stream Survey Manual - DNR Special Report #165</b></a>,<i> Appendix 3 - page 234 (or page 251 in Adobe PDF Reader)</i> at: http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/fisheries/special_reports/165.pdf",
