  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP) is a nationally-competitive land conservation program through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was established to protect important coastal and estuarine areas that have significant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical or aesthetic values. Each year, Maryland s Chesapeake Coastal Program can submit to NOAA up to three project proposals each with a requested funding of $3,000,000 per project and an 1 to 1 match. Project proposals support coastal land conservation goals outlined in Maryland s CELCP plan. Last Updated: 05/2014",
