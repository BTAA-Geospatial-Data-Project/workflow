Research and processing method vary throughout the years:SeismicTracks1985- Tracklines from seismic reflection profiles - Datasonics 3. 5 kHz Ore Geopulse 280j.

Civil/Survey (Softdesk) within AutoCAD was used to generate the surface models. This method used TINS (triangular irregular networks), the most commonly employed method in 1993.
