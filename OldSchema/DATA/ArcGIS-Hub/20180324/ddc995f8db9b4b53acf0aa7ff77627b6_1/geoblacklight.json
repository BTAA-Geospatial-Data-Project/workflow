  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The program strives to strengthen the economic potential of Maryland s traditional main streets and neighborhoods. Using a competitive process, Main Street Maryland selects communities who have made a commitment to succeed and helps them improve the economy, appearance and image of their traditional downtown business districts. To accomplish Main Street goals, DHCD has partnered with the National Trust for Historic Preservation s National Main Street Center, which developed the Main Street Four Point Approach for commercial revitalization. Beginning in 2008, Main Street Maryland programs will also incorporate a Fifth Point: Clean, Safe, and Green. Last Updated: 05/3/2016",
