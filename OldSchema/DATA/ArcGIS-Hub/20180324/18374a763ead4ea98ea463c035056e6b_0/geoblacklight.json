  "dc_description_s": "The DraftDVRPC FY2018 TIP for NJ (FY2018-2021), along with the List of Recommended Changes, will be presented to the DVRPC Board for adoption on October 26, 2017. This important document represents the latest program of transportation projects for the NJ portion of the region. The public comment period for the Draft TIP opened on Monday, August 14, 2017 at 5:00 PM (EST) and extends through Thursday, September 14, 2017, at 5:00 PM (EST). The best way to submit comments is online by using DVRPC?s web-based TIP public comment application located at www.dvrpc.org/TIP. The TIP is the regionally agreed-upon list of priority transportation projects, as required by federal law (ISTEA, TEA-21, SAFETEA LU, MAP-21, and the FAST Act). The TIP document must list all projects that intend to use federal funds, along with all non-federally funded projects that are regionally significant. We also include all other State funded capital projects. The projects are multi-modal; that is, they include bicycle, pedestrian, ITS, and freight related projects, as well as the more traditional highway and public transit projects.",
