Masspoints and breaklines were compiled from Spring 2008 aerial photography using softcopy photogrammetric techniques. Masspoint elevations are in based on NAVD US feet. Masspoints and breaklines were compiled to support generation of a TIN and the subsequent processing of 2 contours. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters for horizontal locations. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
