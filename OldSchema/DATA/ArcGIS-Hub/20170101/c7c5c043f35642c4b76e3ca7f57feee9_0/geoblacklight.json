  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. In 2008, DHCD established the Maple Street designation as a complement to Main Street in order to encourage more investment in residential communities in and around Main Street districts. Four Maple Street communities have been designated to date: Cambridge, Cumberland, Dundalk and Westminster. Maple Street initiatives encourage residential revitalization projects near the business district that strengthen the relationship between downtown commercial districts and the surrounding neighborhoods.
