  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The statewide vector file shows buffered areas that primarily contain habitat for rare, threatened, and endangered species and rare natural community types. It was created over USGS 7. 5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and it generally includes, but does not specifically delineate, such regulated areas as Natural Heritage Areas, Wetlands of Special State Concern, Colonial Waterbird Colonies, and Habitat Protection Areas. Version 1 also included Waterfowl Concentration and Staging Areas, but these areas have not been included in subsequent versions. The file is best displayed by the Group attribute.
