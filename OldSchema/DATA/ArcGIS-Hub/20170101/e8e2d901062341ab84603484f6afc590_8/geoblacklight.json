  "dc_description_s": "This database is a yearly snapshot of deer kill sites as entered by Maintenance field crews. These records are generated from a view that comes from the Maintenance Resource Management System. The data is input from the field staff who are responsible for removal of the deer from the roadway. This does not necessarily correlate to crash data related to deer impacts; this is strictly deer downed within the right of way that are documented and moved by Maintenance staff.",
