  "dc_description_s": "International Roughness Index is a statistic of a pavementsurface s longitudinal profile that quantifies ride quality as the estimatedaccumulation of a passenger vehicle s vertical movement (in inches) as itdrives over the subject road for a distance of one mile. The reported IRIunits are, therefore, inches-per-mile, with a lower IRI value depicting asmoother ride. This Transportation Performance Measurement reports the average IRIcalculation determined from laser-measured elevation changes in each wheelpath.",
