This data set consists of digital data describing sites under the oversight of Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) Land Restoration Program (LRP). Within the LRP, two divisions exist to oversee assessment and remediation of potentially contaminated sites. The State Assessment and Remediation Division includes the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) and CHS Enforcement Sections. The Federal Assessment and Remediation Division includes the Federal IRP Support Section and NPL/Site Assessment section. This dataset describes any VCP applicant or responsible party for the LRP oversight for each site relative to these programs. This layer is intended for use in concert with the LRP Sites layer.",
