  "dc_description_s": "This layer represents footprints of public airports and select heliports in DVRPC's 28-County Data Service Area. The features in this shapefile were generated by digitizing all discernable runways, taxiways, aircraft parking areas, tarmac, and aircraft hangers using the best available aerial imagery. Attribute fields titled RASP and RASP_Type were included to indicate whether an airport is part of DVRPC's Regional Airport System Plan (RASP). The RASP currently contains 24 airports: 3 commercial, 10 reliever, and 11 general aviation or recreational facilities. In addition, the current RASP identifies three operating public use heliports and one military airbase. The DVRPC_REG field indicates whether a facility is within the DVRPC 9-county region. The FP_UPDATED field indicates the year of aerial imagery that was used to update the facility's footprint. Additional attribute data pertaining to these facilities may be sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA provides airport data for the entire United States via various downloadable tables: http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/",
