  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. These are shoal boundaries off the coast of Maryland created by the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS). No formal metadata was received, but MGS describes the data as generalized polygon outlines, mostly qualitative assessments of where the thickness of the sand body pinches out to less than 1 meter thickness over the underlying revinement surface. In some cases it is the 60 foot contour, where there is no seismic data. Last Updated: 03/4/2010",
