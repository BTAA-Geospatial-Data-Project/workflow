Units are in meters. Data were collected jointly with the Delaware Geological Survey during August 1992: First year of the Offshore Sand Resources Study cooperative agreement between the Maryland Geological Survey and the Delaware Geological Survey. R/V Discovery, Datasonics Model SBT-220 Sub-Bottom Profiler operated at frequencies of 3. 5 and 200 kHz. Funding to compile these datasets provided by BOEM under cooperative agreement number: M14AC00007. Data processing and compilation was executed by Maryland Geological Survey. REFS: Conkwright, R.
