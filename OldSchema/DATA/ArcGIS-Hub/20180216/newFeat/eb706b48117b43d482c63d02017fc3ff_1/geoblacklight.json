The units of geography used for the 2010 Census maps displayed here are the Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U. S. Postal Service's postal zip codes. The data collected on the short form survey are general demographic characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, household relationship, housing vacancy and tenure (owner/renter).
