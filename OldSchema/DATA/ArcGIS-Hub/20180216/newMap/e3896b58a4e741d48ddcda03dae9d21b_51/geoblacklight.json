The dataset contains points representing locations and attributes of Metro stations, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies. Platform centroids were identified from visual observation of orthophotography and extracted planimetric data. Centroids were heads-up digitized from the snapbase. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. METADATA CONTENT IS IN PROCESS OF VALIDATION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.",
