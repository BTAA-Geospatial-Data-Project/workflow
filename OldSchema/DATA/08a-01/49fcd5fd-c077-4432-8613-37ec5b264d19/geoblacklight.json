The aerial Orthoimagery was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November) at 1=100\\ scale with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The Orthoimagery is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500\\ x 2,500\\ tiles. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.",
