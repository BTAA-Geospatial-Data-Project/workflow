  "dc_description_s": "This layer identifies 2010 Pennsylvania Census Tracts which meet the PADEP definition for Environmental Justice Areas by having a poverty rate of 20% or greater or a non-white population of 30% or greated. Percentages were rounded up based on a decimal value of .5 or greater for purposes of creating this layer. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.",
