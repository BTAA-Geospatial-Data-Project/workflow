  "dc_description_s": "This data, built off of Michigan Geographic Framework-Version 12b, uses the road network to identify roadways with existing or planned bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities in Southeast Michigan. This data also adds new line work to the Michigan Geographic Framework to help identify shared use pathways that are not within road right-of-way (commonly referred to as trails). Furthermore it identifies existing and planned bike routes (local, county, regional, state, or national) and bicycle friendly roadways which may not have bicycle/pedestrian facilities or official hike-bike routes; but, due to a combination of low traffic volumes and low posted speed, are none-the-less more comfortable to travel on.",
