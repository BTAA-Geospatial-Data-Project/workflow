These features represent only the boundary of the management unit's formal legal description as defined in Statutory law and do not imply management or ownership of lands by the State inside the boundary.-- Polygons of lands managed by the MNDNR Division of Parks and Trails within these statutory boundaries (dnr_management_units_prk).",
