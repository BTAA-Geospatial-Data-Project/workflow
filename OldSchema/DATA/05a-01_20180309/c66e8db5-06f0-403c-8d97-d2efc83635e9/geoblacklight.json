  "dc_description_s": "This the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) area for the Twin Cities. The shape covers the 7 county area as well as the urbanized area that extends beyond the 7 county area.Under state law, the Met Council's jurisdiction covers the 7 county area - Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington counties.Under federal rules, the MPO must plan for the entire urbanized area, which is a Census defined area. After the 2010 Census, the urbanized area for the Twin Cities extended beyond the 7 county area into Wright and Sherburne counties.Thus, for the first time, the MPO jurisdiction area for the Met Council needed to extend beyond the 7 counties. Working with MnDOT, the census defined urbanized area was smoothed and this data file was the officially accepted MPO area for the Twin Cities.",
