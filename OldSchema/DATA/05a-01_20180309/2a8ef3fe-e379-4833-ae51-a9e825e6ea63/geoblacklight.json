These include fires not only on state lands, but also rural private lands for which there is not another agency with primary responsibility. Wildfires that are not included in this theme are those that occur on federal and native American lands (several hundred annually) and those that are responded to by local fire departments (several thousand annually). DNR wildfire suppression responsibility is heaviest in the forested part of the state.",
