  "dc_description_s": "The Right of Way Map Footprint is a GIS data set created to represent the outer footprint or extent of a right of way map (including footprints for both Vector (CAD) and Raster Images). The purpose is to aid the user in more rapidly identifying the desired map for a specific area of interest relative to other maps, roads, landmarks, etc. This data set is developed and maintained on a statewide basis. It does not include geo-referenced representations of right of way maps themselves.",
