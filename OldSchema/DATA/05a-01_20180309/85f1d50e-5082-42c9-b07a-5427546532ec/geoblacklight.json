  "dc_description_s": "This file is a geodatabase that contains annual files for public school district center locations in the state of Minnesota for school years 2006/07-2008/09. The point locations of school district service offices were developed at MDE to complement other school locational information. Many school district offices, or service centers, are located in a current elementary, middle or high school building. Some have their own facility. All locations have been developed and compared to existing school locations or address matched using The Lawrence Group street centerline address files. Unmatched locations were matched through school district websites or Google maps. Some locations may be incorrect as a full QA/QC process has not been completed.This metadata summarizes the content of these files but individual metadata records are also included for each annual file.",
