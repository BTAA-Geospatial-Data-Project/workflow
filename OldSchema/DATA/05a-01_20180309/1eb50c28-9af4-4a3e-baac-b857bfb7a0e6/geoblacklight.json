  "dc_description_s": "The Park-and-Ride layer contains the 238 existing and future park-and-ride and park-and-pool lots in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area and surrounding counties. The dataset was geocoded using TLG centerline streets. When specific site details were available, the geography was moved off the street lines to the actual lot locations using 2005 Markhurd orthophotography as a base layer. All attempts were made to correctly reflect the real lot locations; however, the positional accuracy of this data cannot be guaranteed.The Park-and-Ride Annual Survey lookup table contains information about the capacity and usage at each park-and-ride and park-and-pool facility in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Attribute information is considered current to the metadata date and will be updated as needed.",
