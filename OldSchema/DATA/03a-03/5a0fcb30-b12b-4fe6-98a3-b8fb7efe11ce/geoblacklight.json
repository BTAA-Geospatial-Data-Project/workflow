  "dc_description_s": "Private Well Tracking System Private Well Tracking System Wells Data has four tables that provide additional data: PWTS_contruction provides additional information about well construction. It can be linked (one-to-many relationship) to the well point shape file using the wellnmbr. PWTS_litho consists of lithologic information. It can be linked (one-to-many relationship) to the well point shape file using the wellnmbr. PWTS_production contains pumping information collected from initial capacity testing. It has a one-to-many relation ship with the shapefile and is related throught the wellnmbr field. PWTS_water_quality (limited availability) contains basic water quality information (bacteria and nitrate as nitrogen). It has a one-to-many relation ship with the shapefile and is related throught the wellnmbr field.",
