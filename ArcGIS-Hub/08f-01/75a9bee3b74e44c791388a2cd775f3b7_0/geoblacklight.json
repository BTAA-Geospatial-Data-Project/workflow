  "dc_description_s": "DVRPC Connections 2040 Planning Centershttp://www.dvrpc.org/asp/pubs/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=13042The 2040 Long-Range Plan identifies four types of Centers: Suburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers. The characteristics of each type are as follows:SUBURBAN CENTERSAre regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single ?places;? Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers;Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.TOWN CENTERSHave a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses;Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses;Have a distinct downtown/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development;Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and? Are surrounded by suburban land uses.RURAL CENTERSHave a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area;Have a distinct downtown/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses.PLANNED CENTERSAre planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections. ?",
