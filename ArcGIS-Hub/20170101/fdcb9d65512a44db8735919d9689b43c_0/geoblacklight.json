  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide, continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic, housing, social and economic data. The ACS replaces the decennial census long form in 2010 and every year thereafter. The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of previous long form surveys resulting in a larger sampling error. Coefficients of Variation (CVs), which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate, are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data. The unit of geography used for the 2010 - 2014 data is the census tract - a small statistical area within a county, which is delineated every 10 years prior to the decennial census.
