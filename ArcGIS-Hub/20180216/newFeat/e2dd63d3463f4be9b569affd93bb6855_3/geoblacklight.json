  "dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. These data sets exist in raster and vector formats. The areas in this data set were derived from sitings called in and tracked by Steve Doctor at Matapeake. These sitings were located as points on a map that were contributed by Mr. Doctor and Nancy Butowski, DNR Fisheries Service. Professional guidance was provided by Nancy Butowski and Steve Doctor. The areas were then located on the VIMS shoreline data set and exported as an independent data set. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county. Last Updated: 06/29/2010",
