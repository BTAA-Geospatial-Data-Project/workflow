The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December. For more detail, please see: http:\/\/www.iowadot.gov\/crashanalysis\/top200.htm.",

The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December. For more detail, please see: http:\/\/www.iowadot.gov\/crashanalysis\/top200.htm.",

Eligible areas were designated in The Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable Growth and consist of Activity Centers, Commercial Nodes, Commercial Corridors, and LRT Station Areas. Exact parcel boundaries of Activity Centers and Commercial Nodes are identified in The Minneapolis Plan. Commercial Corridor areas are generally defined as a one block radius from designated corridors. LRT Station Areas are defined as a mile radius from each LRT station outside of downtown. Some staff discretion was used in determining precise boundaries for Commercial Corridors and LRT Station Areas in cases where roadways or other natural boundaries made exact definitions unclear. Each area is categorized based on a number of metrics used to determine its economic health and opportunity. Varying levels of Great Streets program resources are available, based on this categorization.",

Find more information at'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size \/ extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive ('3'C') planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member'jurisdictions'has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:'National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)https:\/\/www.mwcog.org\/tpb\/- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland-'City'of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)https:\/\/baltometro.org\/- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)http:\/\/alleganygov.org\/473\/Metropolitan-Planning-Organization- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown \/ Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)https:\/\/www.hepmpo.net\/- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)http:\/\/www.wilmapco.org\/- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury \/ Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S \/ WMPO)http:\/\/www.swmpo.org\/- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland-'City'of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)http:\/\/www.calvert-stmarysmpo.com\/- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT).

"dc_description_s": "Properties are organized by the category in which they were phased in to the benchmarking program, with important metrics from the most recent reporting year of 2015 being toggleable. By clicking on a point, a user may learn more about an individual property's characteristics, energy efficiency, and water use from prior reporting years when available. Public buildings from the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Minneapolis Public Schools were phased in first and therefore show data for 2012-2015. The largest private buildings 100,000 sqft and greater, show publicly available data starting in 2014. The remaining category, private buildings between 50,000-100,000 sqft in size, data is made publicly available starting with the 2015 dataset. The toggleable metrics highlight the most summary information of building energy and water efficiency: ENERGY STAR score - The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country. The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours. A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer. The higher the score, the more efficient the building. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - The metric used for comparing buildings in Energy Star, EUI expresses a building s energy use relative to its size. In this report it is expressed as kBtu\/ft , and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (in kBtu) and dividing it by the floor area of the building (in ft ). The lower the kBtu\/ft , the lower the energy consumption. Weather-normalized Energy Use Intensity - Energy use is adjusted to account year-to-year weather differences, allowing for comparison of a building to itself over time. Through this procedure, the energy in a given year is adjusted to express the energy that would have been consumed under 30-year average weather conditions. Weather-normalized EUI also uses the kBtu\/ft unit. The maps provided by the City of Minneapolis are compilations of records, information and data from various sources, and they are to be used for reference purposes only. The City of Minneapolis does not warrant or guarantee that the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data or maps are complete, current, or accurate. The City of Minneapolis does not represent that the GIS data can be used for navigational, tracking, legal, engineering, surveying, or any other purpose requiring exacting measurement of distance or direction or precision in the depiction of geographic features. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 466.03, Subdivision 21, the City of Minneapolis disclaims any liability for claims based on alleged or actual inaccuracies in the GIS data or maps.",

"dc_description_s": "Commercial and Industrial Network information for the centerline road segments in the State of Iowa.1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to enhance opportunities for the development and diversification of the state s economy through the identification and improvement of a network of commercial and industrial highways. The network shall consist of interconnected routes which provide long distance route continuity. The purpose of this highway network shall be to improve the flow of commerce; to make travel more convenient, safe, and efficient; and to better connect Iowa with regional, national, and international markets. The commission shall concentrate a major portion of its annual construction budget on this network of commercial and industrial highways. In order to ensure the greatest possible availability of funds for the improvement of the network, primary highway funds shall not be spent beyond continuing maintenance for improvements to route segments that will be bypassed by the relocation of portions of the commercial and industrial highway network. 2. Network selection.a. The commission shall identify, within the primary road system, a network of commercial and industrial highways. The commission shall consider all of the following factors in the identification of this network: i. The connection by the most direct routes feasible of major urban areas and regions of the state to each other and to the national system of interstate and defense highways and priority routes in adjacent states. ii. The existence of high volumes of total traffic and commercial traffic. iii. Long distance traffic movements. iv. Area coverage and balance of spacing with service to major growth centers within the state. v. Metropolitan area bypasses consistent with metropolitan or regional area plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials.b. The network of commercial and industrial highways shall not exceed two thousand six hundred miles including municipal extensions of these highways. 3. Standards. The department shall establish standards pertaining to the specific location, design, and access control for each segment of the commercial and industrial highways. 4. Network development. In establishing priorities for improvement projects, the department shall take into consideration the following additional criteria: urban area bypasses that improve urban or regional accessibility or improve corridor travel; projects consistent with regional or metropolitan transportation plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials; and the willingness of local officials to provide financial or other assistance for the development of projects.Source: Iowa Code Section 313.2A Primary Roads: Commercial and Industrial Highways. http:\/\/search.legis.state.ia.us\/nxt\/gateway.dll\/ic\/1\/13\/10856\/10857\/11188\/11191 f=templatesfn=default.htm.",
