It does not denote that a crime was committed. etails of point locations and crash details table are,Location points with some basic summary statistics,The DC ward the crash occurredSummary totals for: injuries (minor, major, fatal) by type (pedestrian, bicycle, car), mode of travel involved (pedestrian, bicycle, car), impaired participants (pedestrian, bicyclist, car passengers)If speeding was involvedNearest intersecting street nameDistance from nearest intersectionCardinal direction from the intersectionCrash details related table,Type of participant (driver, occupant, bicyclist, pedestrian)Age of participantsIf injured, severity (minor, major, fatal)Type of vehicle (passenger car, large truck, taxi, government, bicycle, pedestrian, etc)If persons issued a ticketIf a vehicle, the state (jurisdiction) license plate was issued (not license plate number)Are any persons deemed impaired Was person in vehicle where speeding was indicatedSome field definitions,CRIMEID - Unique ID for MPD crash report. This is a unique, database-generated ID.CCN - Criminal Complaint Number: a unique identifier assigned by MPD to each incident report. Other law enforcement agencies also request and use CCNs for their reports.REPORTDATE - The date the offense was reported to MPD, which may be later than the date the offense actually occurred.ROUTEID - The unique center line ID number that defines each street. A key part of the DDOT center line network.MEASURE - The measure is the distance along the DDOT center line (in meters) from the beginning of the street\/routeOFFSET - Offset distance (in meters) from the original latitude\/longitude location provided by MPD to the position located along the DDOT center line.STREETSEGID - a street block unique ID for a given road along a DDOT centerline. The street segments break at every street, This is the street segment ID at the crash location.ROADWAYSEGID - unique ID for a given road along a DDOT centerline. The roadway segments break at every street, alley, service road and ramp. This is the roadway segment ID at the crash location.MARID - For crashes that cannot be located using the MPD-supplied latitude\/longitude coordinates, DDOT attempts to locate the crash using the MPD-supplied nearest address. The address is processed against OCTO's Master Address Repository Web services to find the address latitude\/longitude coordinatesADDRESS - The MPD-supplied address associated to the crash. It's assumed that this is the nearest address to the crash location.WARD - DC Ward of the address location, which is supplied by the MAR.EVENTID - DDOT's internally managed LRS ID for the crash locationMAJORINJURIES* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverMINORINJURIES* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverFATAL* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverIMPAIRED* - Total number impaired persons involvedTOTAL_TAXIS - Total number of taxis involved in the crash. NOTE: this does not include car-sharing vehicles such as Lyft or Uber.TOTAL_GOVERNMENT - Total number of DC, federal or other governmental vehicles involved in the crash.SPEEDING_INVOLVED - Indicates if the reporting officer believed speeding was a factor in the crash.

"dc_description_s": "This dataset was retired in 2014. Please refer to thecommon ownership polygon layer in http:\/\/data.dc.gov for the most current data on ownership.Property Owner Points. This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the \"square\" field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file.

Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",
