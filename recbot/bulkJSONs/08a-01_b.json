The BBS was initiated during 1966 by Chan Robbins and his associates at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center to monitor the populations of all breeding bird species across the continental U.S., Canada, and Alaska. Approximately 2200 skilled observers participate in the survey each year. The BBS has accumulated 30 years of data on the abundance, distribution, and trends for more than 400 species of birds. These data are widely used by researchers, various federal and state agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the general public. Analyses of BBS data by PWRC statisticians have been instrumental in the development of innovative approaches for analyzing trends of wildlife populations.",

The Natural Landscape contains the highest concentrations of important natural resources. Appropriate low intensity land uses may develop with special precautions to address natural constraints. Conservation practices will be used to protect and restore the natural resources. The significance of the natural landscape in maintaining biodiversity of species, water recharge areas, and preserving a network of natural resources and habitats will be fully recognized and supported by both citizens and government agencies.",

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

"dc_description_s": "The land surface of Pennsylvania is anything but flat and horizontal. The surface comprises complex arrangements of differences in elevation above mean sea level. The spatial arrangement of these elevation differences comprises topography. Topography that has describable uniformity throughout some areal dimension is termed a landform. Landforms can be classified, boundaries can be drawn, and a map can be created. A preliminary landform map was compiled at approximately 1:605,500 scale. The map has four levels of landform subdivision: province, section, region, and district. These units range in size from many hundreds of square miles (province) to less than 200 square miles (district). The greatest topographic similarity for a given landform unit occurs in the smallest subdivision (district). The greatest topographic dissimilarity for a given landform unit occurs in the largest subdivision (province). The landform map was digitized using ARC\/INFO software. Polygon attributes include name of physiographic province, section, district, and area, and the numerical designation of the landform unit. Arcs were attributed according to whether they form the boundary of one or more of the following: province, section, region, district, or state. These data sets are preliminary and will be superseded in 1999 by more detailed data sets prepared from 1:50,000-scale compilation maps having five levels of landform subdivision.",

"dc_description_s": "The following data set contains all the Oil & Gas Wells in Pennsylvania that the Dept of Enviromental Protection has locational information on. The wells are broken into two formation types of conventional and unconventional wells. A conventional well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of oil or natureal gas from only conventional formation(s). A conventional formation is any formation that does not meet the statutory definition of an unconventional formation. An unconventional gas well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of natural gas from an unconventional formation. Unconventional formation is a geological shale formation existing below the base of the Elk Sandstone or its geologic equivalent stratigraphic interval where natural gas generally cannot be produced at economic flow rates or in economic volumes except by vertical or horizontal well bores stimulated by hydraulic fracture treatments or by using multilateral well bores or other techniques to expose more of the formation to the well bore. The following fields are displayed in the data set: PERMIT_NUM is the Permit Number associated with the well, WELL_NAME is the name given to the well by DEP or the Operator, OPERATOR the name of the current operator for the well, OPER_NUM is the Operator Number associated with the current operator, WELL_TYPE describes the type of well, WELL_TYPECD is the code associated with the Well type, WELL_STAT is the current status of the well, WELL_STATCD is the code associated with the current well status, PERM_DATE is the date associated with the permit number, SPUD_DATE is the drilling commencement date, or proposed drilling commencement date as reported by the operator, CONSV_IND indicates whether thie wellbore penetrates the Onondaga horizon as defined in the PA Oil & Gas Conservation Law, COUNTY is the county the well is permitted in, COUNTY_ID is the code associated to the county, MCD is the municipality that the well is in, MCD_TYPE is the type of municipality that the well is in, MCD_CD is the code associated to the municipality name, LATITUDE is the latitude of the well bore hole, LONGITUDE is the longitude of the well bore hole, PRMRY_FID is a system generated id associated with the primary facility record for this well in the DEP eFACTS database, UNCV_IND indicates whether this is a conventional or unconventional well, SURFACE_ELEV is the ground elevation at the well head location, WELL_CONFIG_CD indicates the well configuration, COAL_IND indicates if the well is in a coal or non coal region, PLUG_C_DATE is the well plug completion date, WELL_PAD is the name of the well pad on which the well is located.",

"dc_description_s": "The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting\\r\\ndata used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance\\r\\nflood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM\\r\\nDatabase is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps\\r\\n(FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data,\\r\\nwhere available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\\r\\nThe file is georeferenced to earth\\s surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system.The\\r\\nspecifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for\\r\\nmapping at a scale of 1:12,000.",

The long-term goals of the EBTJV are to develop a comprehensive restoration and education strategy to improve aquatic habitat, to raise education awareness, and to raise federal, state and local funds for brook trout conservation. In 2005, in recognition of the need to address regional and range-wide threats to brook trout, a group of public and private entities formed the EBTJV to halt the decline of brook trout and restore fishable populations. The group spearheaded a range-wide assessment of brook trout populations and threats to brook trout and brook trout habitat in the Eastern United States (report forthcoming). Seventeen states are currently drafting strategies to prioritize policy changes and on-the-ground actions to improve water quality and restore brook trout habitat and populations in their individual state using locally-driven, incentive-based, and non-regulatory programs.",

"dc_description_s": "The concern caused by the explosive spread of the zebra mussel, (Dreissena polymorpha), within the United States resulted in passage of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-646). The impact of this biofouling pest on the economy and ecological processes in the U.S. and Canada has required prompt action on a large scale to prevent further infestations and minimize ecological degradation. This map layer is a compilation of reports of confirmed zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to January 2008. It provides geographical and historical information to show distribution over time. The reports came from a variety of Federal, State, and municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and private consultant firms. The locations of confirmed sightings were registered at 1:100,000-scale on EPA Reach File Version 3.0 and are maintained as an ArcInfo export file. This is a revised version of the June 2005 map layer.",

The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are:_____Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. NPDES Discharge Point is an effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam. Includes, but is not limited to, strip, auger, quarry, dredging, and leaching mines.",

The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process. Air Pollution Control Device: Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber. Combustion Unit: Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine. Fuel Material Location: Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines. General Administrative Location: An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat\/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level. Incinerator: Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators. Point of Air Emission: Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility. Process: Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns. Continuous Emission Monitoring Point: Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.",

"dc_description_s": "Protected areas are cornerstones of national and international conservation strategies. By way of these designations, lands and waters are set-aside in-perpetuity to preserve functioning natural ecosystems, act as refuges for species, and maintain ecological processes. Complementary conservation strategies preserve land for the sustainable use of natural resources, or for the protection of significant geologic and cultural features or open space. PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) attempts to include all available spatial data on these places. It is our goal to publish the most comprehensive geospatial data set of U. S. protected areas to date. PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) is limited to the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. It does not include protected areas data for U.S. territories at this time. The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) data set portrays the nation's protected areas with a standardized spatial geometry and numerous valuable attributes on land ownership, management designations, and conservation status (using national GAP and international IUCN coding systems). The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) defines protected area to include all lands dedicated to the preservation of biology diversity and to other natural, recreation and cultural uses, and managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means (adapted from IUCN definition). The database represents the full range of conservation designations that preserve these natural resources in the United States. Our database does not distinguish a protection threshold above which biodiversity is considered secure. Instead, a complete suite of protected area attributes are provided for each polygon with the purpose of giving users the information they need to define the most relevant conservation thresholds for their own objectives and requirements. Collaborating with the nation's leading data providers, the goal is to provide an annual update.",

"dc_description_s": "Part of the Pennsylvania Gap Analysis Project the Breeding Bird Atlas database indicates bird species and nesting behavior of known birds species in Pennsylvania. The database is organized into two primary segments; the block and the species lists (data). Blocks are defined by a code for the USGS topographic map, and the block number. All records are organized by the Atlas region. Various attributes of the Atlas block are incorporated, including geographic features (physiographic locations), effort (hours of fieldwork). The species segment, being replicated the full 320,000 times, was kept to a minimal size, and lists only the species and breeding code, the year and comment. Evidence of birds nesting within an Atlas block was recorded with a set of codes that describe behavior and physical evidence of nesting. These codes are divided into four hierarchical categories, three of which indicate breeding. 'Observed,' 'Possible,' 'Probable,' and 'Confirmed' breeding codes represent increasing evidence that nesting occurred within the block a species was recorded. 'Probable' and 'Confirmed' categories were further segregated into hierarchical codes that represent individual breeding behaviors or physical evidence of nesting. A description of breeding codes may be provided upon request. All of Pennsylvania's 4,928 atlas 'blocks' were surveyed, with an average of 65 species per block recorded. A total of 188 breeding species were documented statewide. Data catalogued geographically by atlas 'block,' USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, county, and physiographic province. Species files include political status designation and a number of life-history characteristics.",

This GIS Dataset is a representation of the Landscapes identified in the plan. The concept of livable landscapes provides a framework for protection and growth strategies within Chester County. The map provides a guide for accommodating expected future growth while maintaining the quality of life in the county. The Livable Landscapes map is divided into two core areas, growth areas and rural resource areas, as prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. The growth areas consist of the urban landscape and the suburban landscape. The rural resource areas consist of the agricultural landscape and the rural landscape. The natural landscape exists throughout the county recognizing the important network of natural resources needing specific protection. Livable landscapes recognizes the diversity that makes Chester County a special place. Each landscape has a different character and is appropriate for different intensities and varieties of development. The urban and suburban landscapes can best accommodate future growth. The county will encourage future development to be concentrated in these landscapes. The rural and agricultural landscapes are least appropriate for intense growth. The county will not encourage development in these landscapes. Livable landscapes is not a land use map. Any land use can be found in each of the landscapes, but the mix and intensity of land uses will be different to preserve the character of each landscape.",

"dc_description_s": "NWI digital data files are records of wetlands location and classification as developed by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean. Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative, with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps. See section on 'Completeness_Report' for more information.

"dc_description_s": "Many streams, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs are officially classified as 'stocked trout waters.' This means that these waters contain significant portions that are open to public fishing and are stocked with trout. The waters in this layer are flowing waters (not lakes) classified as 'stocked trout waters' and these are open to trout harvest during the 'extended season' (see Commonwealth Inland Waters). Unlisted tributary streams (those not included in this list of 'approved trout waters') are not open to harvest of trout during the 'extended season.' Only approved trout waters and all waters downstream of approved trout waters are open during this period. Spearing fish is not permitted in any of these waters at any time of the year. These waters are closed to all fishing (including taking of minnows) from March 1 to 8 a.m. on the opening day of the trout season. A person shall be deemed to be fishing if he or she has in possession any fishing line, rod, or other device that can be used for fishing while on or in any water or on the banks within 25 feet of any water where fishing is prohibited. Check with the nearest Fish and Boat Commission office if there is any question about whether or not a water area is 'approved.'",

"dc_description_s": "Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic\/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc\/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work. A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries.

In 2007, PEMA concluded a broader statewide study using the latest version of HAZUS-MH MR 2.0 that includes damage estimates for 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 year flood events. The study computed damages in dollars for total economic loss, building and content damage, and other economic impacts. The study also estimated the number of damaged homes and the degree of damage to those homes.\\r\\n \\r\\nWith these results, Statewide GIS shapefiles for economic losses and damaged homes were created for each flood scenario using ArcMap 9.1. These files can be displayed using ArcMap 9.0 or higher version - you do not need the HAZUS software to use them. They can be overlaid on other GIS maps (county, local roads, street maps, municipal maps, etc) to show the location and extent of potential flood damages for each of the flood severity levels.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Flood Study maps and information contained in these files can by used local emergency management agencies, GIS and planning departments, watershed organizations, and other interested parties for hazard identification and risk assessment, mitigation planning, and flood response training activities.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: These files are estimates of damages and locations generated by the FEMA HAZUS flood analysis model. These files do not include all possible flood risk areas and are not based on actual past flood events. The data should not be used to determine regulated floodplain areas or the location of individual homes and buildings.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe GIS files for the various flood events have been compressed (ZIP files) and can be downloaded from this webpage. The size of the files range from 4 MBs to 25 MBs - download time may be considerable depending on the speed of your Internet connection. Contained in each ZIP file are Pennsylvania Statewide Flood Study ARCGIS shapefiles generated with the HAZUS Multihazard Flood Risk Analysis program.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe shapefiles represent all census blocks affected by each flood event. The economic loss layer shows total losses in thousands of dollars. The damaged homes layer shows the number of flood-affected residential structures. Additional information for each layer is contained in its attribute table which can be viewed and edited in ArcMap. The display can also be modified or enhanced by changing the layer\\s properties in ArcMap (change the display to classified and the number of classes to 10, for example).",

"dc_description_s": "In 2006, PEMA completed a statewide study of a 100 year flood event using FEMA HAZUS-MH risk analysis software.  In 2007, PEMA concluded a broader statewide study using the latest version of HAZUS-MH MR 2.0 that includes damage estimates for 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 year flood events. The study computed damages in dollars for total economic loss, building and content damage, and other economic impacts. The study also estimated the number of damaged homes and the degree of damage to those homes. With these results, Statewide GIS shapefiles for economic losses and damaged homes were created for each flood scenario using ArcMap 9.1. These files can be displayed using ArcMap 9.0 or higher version - you do not need the HAZUS software to use them. They can be overlaid on other GIS maps (county, local roads, street maps, municipal maps, etc) to show the location and extent of potential flood damages for each of the flood severity levels. The Flood Study maps and information contained in these files can by used local emergency management agencies, GIS and planning departments, watershed organizations, and other interested parties for hazard identification and risk assessment, mitigation planning, and flood response training activities.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: These files are estimates of damages and locations generated by the FEMA HAZUS flood analysis model. These files do not include all possible flood risk areas and are not based on actual past flood events. The data should not be used to determine regulated floodplain areas or the location of individual homes and buildings.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe GIS files for the various flood events have been compressed (ZIP files) and can be downloaded from this webpage. The size of the files range from 4 MBs to 25 MBs - download time may be considerable depending on the speed of your Internet connection. Contained in each ZIP file are Pennsylvania Statewide Flood Study ARCGIS shapefiles generated with the HAZUS Multihazard Flood Risk Analysis program. The shapefiles represent all census blocks affected by each flood event. The economic loss layer shows total losses in thousands of dollars. The damaged homes layer shows the number of flood-affected residential structures. Additional information for each layer is contained in its attribute table which can be viewed and edited in ArcMap. The display can also be modified or enhanced by changing the layer's properties in ArcMap (change the display to classified and the number of classes to 10, for example).",

"dc_description_s": "In 1859, the United States first commercial oil well was drilled in Venango County, Pennsylvania. In the 150 years subsequent to this, an unknown number of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the state. A current estimate by the Independent Petroleum Association of America places that number at approximately 325,000. Of those 325,000 wells, over 200,000 are still unaccounted for. As these wells are found and verified, they are cataloged in the Department of Environmental Protections (DEP) Abandoned and Orphan Well database to facilitate plugging. There are currently over 8,200 wells listed in this database (2013). With so many unknown oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania and the environmental threats that they pose, identification remains a vital component of DEPs Oil and Gas Program. Currently, the DEP, Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and geo-referencing. These maps, which vary in age, not only contain information on historic mine locations, but also oil and gas locations. Through collaboration between the Bureau of Mining Programs and the Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, potential oil and gas well locations were assembled using three mine map collections. These collections include the WPA mine map collection, KSheets collection, and the HSheets collection. From these sources, over 30,000 potential historic oil and gas well locations were derived. The Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management is constantly looking for historic sources to help locate oil and gas wells in the state that remain unaccounted for. This particular dataset was created using georeferenced mine maps of various\/unknown accuracy and various\/unknown coordinate systems to various base maps, including but not limited to USGS topographic maps and PAMAP aerial photography. The locations were then digitized using the georeferenced mine maps. These locations are provided for informational purposes only and should not be sole means of decision making and are in no way a substitute for actual field observations.",

The hubs and corridors are the major concentration of the map and serve as the core conservation areas in the PA Highlands Greenway. The hub and spoke system was created by AMC by combining the results of two analysis techniques, stronghold analysis and the Natural Lands Trusts Smart ConservationTM.. Stronghold analysis identifies areas that are least affected by man-made disturbances such as roads and fragmentation of the natural landscape while Smart Conservation determines the ecological health of an area. The combination of these two analyses in conjunction with the knowledge of local stakeholders was used to prioritize core conservation areas.",

Montgomery County Planning Commission provided in-kind funding for the project as well as completing the assessment portion in Montgomery Count. Heritage Conservancy completed the assessment for the areas in Bucks County and Philadelphia County. Both organizations then mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. The 1' pixel resolution 2010 aerials from DVRPC served as the basis for the riparian conditions along the waterways. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). This dataset is an assessment of the same area completed back in 200-2004. The same methodology of creating 50 foot buffers from the edge of water to assess the tree cover in this area was used. The stream centerline is used to represent the classification of whether one side, both sides, or neither side has tree cover. In addition to the three categories from the previous assessment, the category of culvert was added to incorporate areas where there was not an opportunity for tree cover.",

The conservancy then assessed various watersheds in southeastern Pennsylvania and mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. Interpretation of 1' = 400' black-and-white high altitude aerial photographs, Orthophotos, and videotape from helicopter over flights were used to determine the presence or absence of a forested buffer for 1,200 miles of stream. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). A series of large-scale (1' = 400') maps were produced showing sections of stream bank lacking forest buffers. Local conservation groups were given the maps to assist them in targeting areas for riparian buffer plantings to improve water quality.",

The hub and spoke system was created by AMC by combining the results of two analysis techniques, stronghold analysis and the Natural Lands Trusts Smart ConservationTM.. Stronghold analysis identifies areas that are least affected by man-made disturbances such as roads and fragmentation of the natural landscape while Smart Conservation determines the ecological health of an area. The combination of these two analyses in conjunction with the knowledge of local stakeholders was used to prioritize core conservation areas.",

"dc_title_s": "Northern Lancaster County Groundwater Study: Pennsylvania",
"dc_description_s": "Contains various shapefiles, pdf's, and jpeg maps pertaining to the Northern Lancaster County Groungwater study. Layer inculde groundwater basin shapefiles include - river basins, MCD's, census blocks, sewage treament outfalls, water use, study area, dry stream valley systems, geology, karst modified uplands, impervious surfaces, wetlands. JPEG maps include study area, basins, withdraws, conductivity, nitrates, geology, water tables, flowlines, mapplate. Achieving a balance among environmental, human, and economic needs in the management of the basin?s water resources is a critical mission of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (Commission), as described in the 1971 Susquehanna River Basin Compact (Compact). The Commission carries out its water resource management responsibilities in a number of ways through its regulatory program, public education and information, and resource evaluation. In areas of intense water resource utilization, the Commission may conduct special studies, water budget analyses, and identify critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs). The Commission, in partnership with the Lancaster County Conservation District (LCCD), performed a groundwater resources evaluation of a carbonate valley located in northern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The project was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) through its Growing Greener Grant Program. The study area includes an isolated carbonate aquifer of 50 square miles and a surrounding siliciclastic contributing area of 20 square miles. Parts of 13 municipalities, including the Boroughs of Manheim, Lititz, Akron, Ephrata, and Denver, are located in the study area. Groundwater is the primary source of water for municipal, domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. As groundwater withdrawals increase to meet growing demands, stakeholders need information on the location and quantity of water resources available, and how to best develop, conserve, and protect them. Removal of groundwater resources faster than the sustainable rate could lead to a growing water deficit, the gradual failure of water supplies, diminishing stream and spring flows, and degraded aquatic and riparian habitat. Project participants involved the local public during the course of the study through a Water Budget Advisory Committee (WBAC) and educational workshops. Important resource areas are identified, and management recommendations for these areas are provided in this report. The study area has experienced rapid growth. From 1990 to 2000, several municipalities in the study area exceeded Lancaster County?s growth rate of 11.3 percent. Warwick Township, located in the Manheim?Lititz groundwater basin, experienced the highest growth rate of 33.2 percent. Anticipated growth and development in the study area are expected to result in 2 increased water demand. Population projections from 2000 through 2025 represent a 26 percent increase. Historic changes in land use have led to increased impervious areas, increased stormwater runoff, and reduced infiltration. Impervious cover was 9 percent of the 70-squaremile study area. This potentially reduces average annual recharge by 1,575 million gallons in the study area. When one considers the carbonate areas of the Manheim-Lititz and Ephrata area groundwater basins, 12.6 percent and 8 percent of these areas are impervious, respectively. The focus of the study is a valley approximately 50 square miles in area, underlain by a highly productive carbonate aquifer, and herein informally termed the ?carbonate valley.? The carbonate valley is surrounded almost entirely by hills underlain by aquifers of much lower permeability (Figure 2). The carbonate valley includes parts of the Chiques Creek, Cocalico Creek, and Lititz Run watersheds. Streams generally flow from north to south across the study area, with the exception of the largest stream, Cocalico Creek, which flows from northeast to southwest. The study area includes parts of 8 townships and 5 boroughs, and had a population of approximately 61,000 in the year 2000. Water supply needs are met almost entirely by groundwater. The valley was once largely agricultural, but is rapidly changing to a mosaic of urban, suburban, and agricultural areas. The population in the carbonate valley is rapidly growing, as is the need for water. However, the amount of water available is limited. Most of the groundwater is derived from the carbonate aquifer that underlies the valley. The presence of sinkholes, abundant closed depressions, large springs, and lack of streams in many areas suggests that dissolution of the carbonate bedrock, a condition known as karst, has substantially enhanced the ability of the aquifer to store and transmit water. Karst aquifers are known for their abundant water resources and extremely high well yields, as well as their hard water, enigmatic flow patterns, sinkholes, and high susceptibility to contamination.",

"dc_description_s": "Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts\/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, dry, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown. The well information was initially retrieved from the IHS Energy Group, PI\/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, which is a proprietary, commercial database containing information for most oil and gas wells in the U.S. Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary PI\/Dwights PLUS Well Data. No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps. The data from PI\/Dwights PLUS Well Data were current as of October 2001 when the cell maps were created in 2002.",

The sub-facility types related to Municipal Waste Operations that are included are:_Composting: Includes facilites that use land for processing municipal waste by composting. Composting is a process that biologically decomposes organic waste under controlled anaerobic or aerobic conditions to yield a humus-like product. Land Application: Includes facilities that uses agricultural utilization or land reclamation of waste. Sewage sludge is land-applied for its nutrient value or as a soil conditioner. Landfill - Abandoned: The Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project collects geospatial and descriptive data for closed and abandoned landfills throughout the state of Pennsylvania. Locations for sites were determined from historic records such as microfiche, index card, topographic map, and staff personal files, and then compiled into site lists. Each of the six DEP regions is staffed with summer interns who physically locate the sites and collect the data for the project. The purpose of the Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project is to determine the location of abandoned and closed landfills in order to catalog potential environmental hazards. The data is intended for internal government and public consumption, in order to keep property sales, clean-up efforts, and land development well informed. For metadata on the ALI Project, see Abandonded Landfill Metadata. Landfill: A landfill is a facility that uses land for the disposal of municipal waste. Processing Facility: A processing facility is a transfer station, composting facility, resource recovery facility, or a facility that reduces the volume or bulk of municipal waste for offsite reuse. Resource Recovery: A resource recovery is a facility that provides for the extraction and utilization of materials or energy from municipal waste. The facility can be a mechanical extraction facility or a combustion facility. Transfer Station: A transfer station is a facility that receives and processes or temporarily stores municipal waste at a location other than the generation site. This sub-facility facilitates the transportation or transfer of municipal waste to a processing or disposal facility.",

Landscape composition was summarized by extracting information of a set of patches of the same type (i.e., a NLCD land use class) within each circle. The following NLCD land use classes were studied: (1) water, (2) developed, open space, (3) developed, low intensity, (4) developed, medium intensity, (5) developed, high intensity, (6) barren, rock\/clay\/sand, (7) forest, (8) shrub, scrub, (9) pasture, hay, (10) cultivated crops, and (11) wetlands. In addition, four indicators of human activity -Total Core Area Index, Road Density, Landscape Development Intensity Index, and Impervious Surface- were quantified by integrating land cover and road network information.",

The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources. The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use\/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Using an inside buffer of 18 meters on the Landscape Blocks a new shapefile was created in order to create a 30 meter area between the blocks to represent roads. Natural vegetation cover (Water, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Woody Wetland, and Emergent Wetland) from the 2005 Land Cover was reclassified and then the road buffered landscape blocks were combined with the raster to assign a value of '0' to areas in the natural vegetation land cover that overlap with the road buffers. Acreage of the contiguous natural vegetation was calculated and the data was reclassified based on conservation value as follows: Acreage Conservation Value 0-100 0 100-250 1 250-500 2 500-1000 3 1000-2500 4 2500-5000 5 5000-7500 6 7500-15000 7 15000-25000 8 25000-40000 9 > 40000 10 Conservation values were determined by experts gathered by Natural Lands Trust through SmartConservation. This data set is one of several that have been combined to create an overall terrestrial resources conservation value raster for the High Allegheny Plateau Ecoregion. Therefore the values were determined as a relative rank, comparable in value only to the other input terrestrial resources data. Conservation value ranges from 1 - 10 with 10 being the highest value.",

"dc_description_s": "This dataset, produced by the PAMAP Program, consists of an orthorectified digital raster image (i.e. orthoimage) with a horizontal ground resolution of 1 foot.  An orthoimage is a remotely sensed image that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement, and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation.  Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  Source images were captured in natural color at a negative scale of 1:19200.  PAMAP data are organized into blocks, which do not have gaps or overlaps, that represent 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet on the ground. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block\\s northwest corner, the State identifier PA, and the State Plane zone designator N or S (e.g. 45001210PAS).",

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of West Virginia. This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group.

The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of New Jersey This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703\/877-8000.

The USGS The National High Altitude Photography (NHAP) program, which was operated from 1980-1989, was coordinated by the U.S. Geological Survey as an interagency project to eliminate duplicate photography in various Government programs. The aim of the program was to cover the 48 conterminous states over a 5-year span. In the NHAP program, black-and-white and color-infrared aerial photographs were obtained on 9-inch film from an altitude of 40,000 feet above mean terrain elevation and are centered over USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles. The color-infrared photographs are at a scale of 1:58,000 (1 inch equals about .9 miles). All NHAP flights were flown in a North to South direction. These photographs are offered as digital images (https:\/\/catalog.data.gov\/datasethap-national-high-altitude-aerial-photography-1980-1989 , April 2017). In 2016, Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps & Geospatial Information at The Pennsylvania State University obtained high quality digital images of 9x9 film from USDA - FSA Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO). Digital images were captured at 2,032 dpi with Wehrli and Associates, Inc. RM-6 and RM-3 photogrammetric scanners.

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 2-feet pixel resolution. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 4.8 feet at the 95% confidence level. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator PA, and the State Plane zone designator S.",

"dc_description_s": "The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Database (NED).The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to a consistent datum, edge-match, fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams, recast the data to a consistent geographic projection and convert all elevation values to decimal meters as a consistent unit of measure.NED has a resolution of one-third arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for much of the conterminous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico in a NAD83 datum. There is a resolution of two arc-seconds for Alaska and the datum is NAD27.NED at 10 meters is created using the same methods outlined above with the source data being mostly the 10m DEMs. DEMs at 5 meters, 1\/3 arc-second, and 1\/9 arc-second maps are also used where available. In some cases, the 10m NED is resampled from LIDAR or created using aerial photography.One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. Artifact removal greatly improves the quality of the slope, shaded-relief, and synthetic drainage information that can be derived from the elevation data.  Geospatial elevation data are used by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping, and visualization applications.NRCS has elected to ONLY serve NED 10 which is 10 meter or better and not NED 10 which was resampled from 30 meter. NRCS also serves the maps in a UTM projection. These two facts differentiate the maps from those served at http:\/\/seamless.usgs.gov\/.",

High resolution land cover dataset for Prince Georges County. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass\/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 0.5 ft square . The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2009 LiDAR and 2009 Color Infrared Imagery (3 band). Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, impervious surfaces, roads, railroads, water) provided by M-NCPPC. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2009. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.

PAMAP data are organized into blocks, which do not have gaps or overlaps, that represent 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet on the ground. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block's northwest corner, the State identifier 'PA', and the State Plane zone designator 'N' or 'S' (e.g. 45001210PAS).",

"dc_description_s": "Mapping Area polygon - High resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin, an area comprised of parts of six counties in the state of New York and four counties in Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass\/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.

The aerial LiDAR was acquired at a point density average of 1-meter with final products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November). The LiDAR is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500' x 2,500' tiles (which matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Each LiDAR file is approximately 40 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The LiDAR data will be utilized for the rectification of aerial imagery to produce 1=100 scale ortho-imagery with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The LiDAR data will also be used as a component during the future delineation of project area wide impervious surfaces (using remote sensing techniques). FINAL DELIVERABLES: The final deliverables are listed below. The final LiDAR data was delivered in a State Plane projection tiling format, based on a modular layout. The tiles were clipped to eliminate overlap between adjacent tiles. The 2500 feet x 2500 feet tile file name was derived from the lower left coordinates of each tile.  LAS v1.2 classified point cloud NAD83 (NSRS2007) Pennsylvania State Plane North Zone U.S. Feet, NAVD88 GEOID09 U.S. Feet.  Tile data extent provided as ESRI v10.0 shapefile.

"dc_description_s": "High resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin, an area comprised of parts of six counties in the state of New York and four counties in Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass\/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color\/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.",

Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, road polygons, and hydrography) provided by City of Philadelphia. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2008. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color\/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control. More than 30700 corrections were made to the classification.",

Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Extensive quality assurance and quality control methods were employed. This dataset has been independently reviewed by two separate organizations.",

The aerial LiDAR was acquired at a point density average of 1-meter with final products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November). The LiDAR is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500 x 2,500 tiles (which matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Each LiDAR file is approximately 40 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The LiDAR data will be utilized for the rectification of aerial imagery to produce 1 201d=100 2019 scale ortho-imagery with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The LiDAR data will also be used as a component during the future delineation of project area wide impervious surfaces (using remote sensing techniques).",

This data represents the potential flood extent for a stage of 11-ft to 37-ft as recorded at the Harrisburg (Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, PA; USGS ID 01570500) river gage. This data is part of a series of inundation layers meant to correlate observations and forecasts from the river gage with a visual representation of the areas impacted by high water. The data set of flood inundation areas was created from flood scenarios generated by HEC-RAS runs provided by USACE-Baltimore and LiDAR data from PASDA processed to extract bare earth points. A shapefile of inundation area for each stage was created and subsequently merged to form continuous datasets for the main-stem Susquehanna River and backwater areas on its tributaries.This data was developed to assist the public and emergency officials with planning and response to high water episodes at or near a defined National Weather Service river forecast point.",

The model was constructed from PAMAP LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation points. PAMAP data are organized into blocks, which do not have gaps or overlaps, that represent 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet on the ground. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block\\s northwest corner, the State identifier PA, and the State Plane zone designator N or S (e.g. 45001210PAS).",

LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 711 individual 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot tiles. Tile names use the following naming schema: YYYYXXXXPAd where YYYY is the first 3 characters of the tile\\s upper left corner Y-coordinate, XXXX - the first 4 characters of the tile\\s upper left corner X-coordinate, PA = Pennsylvania, and d = \\N\\ for North or \\S\\ for South. Corresponding 2.5-foot gridded hydro-flattened bare earth raster tiled DEM files and intensity image files were created using the same 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Continuous 2-foot contours were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR collection began in Spring 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 84 control points (24 calibration control points and 60 QC checkpoints). These were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area.",
