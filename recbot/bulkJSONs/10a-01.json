"dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents municipal wards for Wisconsin in 2011. These municipal wards were created by grouping Census 2010 population collection blocks into municipal wards. This project started with the release of Census 2010 geography and population totals to all 72 Wisconsin counties on March 21st2011. Census Geography and population totals to be used for local redistricting were made available on the Wisconsin Shape Editor for Local Redistricting (WISE-LR) website (http:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/wiselr\/) and the WISE-LR web application located at http:\/\/wiselr.legis.wisconsin.gov. The 180 day statutory timeline for local redistricting to occur in Wisconsin ended on September 19th, 2011. Wisconsin Legislative and congressional redistricting plans were enacted in the fall of 2011. 2011 Wisconsin Act 43 and Act 44 created new Assembly, Senate and Congressional lines for the state. These new districts were created using Census 2010 block geography. Some municipal wards that were created before Act 43 and 44 were enacted, which created municipal wards in some communities to be split between assembly, senate and congressional districts. 2011 Wisconsin Act 39 allowed communities to divide wards affected, along census blocks. Newly formed wards created under Wisconsin Act 39 would need named using alpha-numeric labels (ward 1 divided by an assembly district would become ward 1A and ward 1B, or the next sequential ward number would have to be used, ward 1 and ward 2). The process of dividing wards under Act 39 ended on April 10th, 2012. This link provides more information on Act 39. http:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/lrb\/pubs\/Lb\/11Lb1.pdfThe United States Eastern District Federal Court on April 11th2012 ordered Assembly Districts 8 and 9 (both in the City of Milwaukee) be changed to follow the court\u2019s description. http:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/ltsb\/redistricting\/PDFs\/120411_Eastern_Dist_order.pdfOn September 19th, 2012 the Legislative Technology Services Bureau (LTSB) divided the few remaining municipal wards that were divided by a 2011 Wisconsin Act 43 or 44 district line.",

These municipal wards were created by grouping Census 2010 population collection blocks into municipal wards. This project started with the release of Census 2010 geography and population totals to all 72 Wisconsin counties on March 21st2011. Census Geography and population totals to be used for local redistricting were made available on the Wisconsin Shape Editor for Local Redistricting (WISE-LR) website (http:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/wiselr\/) and the WISE-LR web application located at http:\/\/wiselr.legis.wisconsin.gov. The 180 day statutory timeline for local redistricting to occur in Wisconsin ended on September 19th, 2011. Wisconsin Legislative and congressional redistricting plans were enacted in the fall of 2011. 2011 Wisconsin Act 43 and Act 44 created new Assembly, Senate and Congressional lines for the state. These new districts were created using Census 2010 block geography. Some municipal wards that were created before Act 43 and 44 were enacted, which created municipal wards in some communities to be split between assembly, senate and congressional districts. 2011 Wisconsin Act 39allowed communities to divide wards affected, along census blocks. Newly formed wards created under Wisconsin Act 39 would need named using alpha-numeric labels (ward 1 divided by an assembly district would become ward 1A and ward 1B, or the next sequential ward number would have to be used, ward 1 and ward 2). The process of dividing wards under Act 39 ended on April 10th, 2012. This link provides more information on Act 39. http:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/lrb\/pubs\/Lb\/11Lb1.pdf The United States Eastern District Federal Court on April 11th2012 ordered Assembly Districts 8 and 9 (both in the City of Milwaukee) be changed to follow the court\u2019s description. http:\/\/legis.wisconsin.gov\/ltsb\/redistricting\/PDFs\/120411_Eastern_Dist_order.pdfOn September 19th, 2012 the Legislative Technology Services Bureau (LTSB) divided the few remaining municipal wards that were divided by a 2011 Wisconsin Act 43 or 44 district line.",

The Wisconsin Land Cover Grid is a raster representation of land cover derived from Landsat satellite imagery. The source data were acquired from the nationwide MRLC (Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium) acquisition of dual-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data primarily from 1992. The image processing technique followed was published in the UMGAP Image Processing Protocol (1998).The original pixel size of the source TM data is 30 meters, however the classified WISCLAND Land Cover data (excluding URBAN) are generalized or 'smoothed' to an area no smaller than four contiguous pixels (equivalent to approximately one acre). The result of this smoothing is that any feature five acres or larger may be resolved in the data (i.e., Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of five acres). The Land Cover data are usable at nominal scales of 1:40,000 to 1:500,000 for a wide variety of resource management and planning applications. The classification scheme was designed to be compatible with existing classification schemes such as UNESCO's and Anderson's.",

The image processing technique followed was published in the 'Development of a Landscape Level Monitoring Methodology Based on Mapping Invasive Species, Phase II: Statewide Mapping of Wetlands Dominated by Reed Canary Grass, Phalaris arundinacea L.' (2007). The pixel size of the source data is 30 meters. The result of this is that any feature one-half of an acre or larger may be resolved in the data (i.e., Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of one-half acre). The reed canary grass data are usable at nominal scales of 1:40,000 to 1:500,000 for a wide variety of wetland assessment and wetland restoration planning applications.",

"dc_description_s": "This Grid-format data set, known as WISCLAND Land Cover, is a raster representation of land cover of Wisconsin derived from Landsat satellite imagery. The source data were acquired from the nationwide MRLC (Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium) acquisition of dual-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data primarily from 1992. The image processing technique followed was published in the UMGAP Image Processing Protocol (1998).The original pixel size of the source TM data is 30 meters, however the classified WISCLAND Land Cover data (excluding URBAN) are generalized or 'smoothed' to an area no smaller than four contiguous pixels (equivalent to approximately one acre). The result of this smoothing is that any feature five acres or larger may be resolved in the data (i.e., Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of five acres). The Land Cover data are usable at nominal scales of 1:40,000 to 1:500,000 for a wide variety of resource management and planning applications. The classification scheme was designed to be compatible with existing classification schemes such as UNESCO's and Anderson's.",

"dc_description_s": "The goal of this project is to attribute hydrography features within the state of Wisconsin. Some features in Wisconsin have watersheds that include areas outside of the state. Examples of this include the Nemadji drainage in Minnesota and the entire Mississippi River. We included necessary out-of-state features whenever possible in order to have complete watershed coverage. We also included all out-of-state features that are within HUC12s that cross the Wisconsin border. This latter inclusion allowed for more accurate watershed delineations. Because we delineated sheds within HUC12 boundaries, it was important to have all possible features included in delineations so that no feature was assigned an overly large watershed. The major exceptions to the out-of-state inclusions were for four major boundary rivers: the St. Louis, St. Croix (along the state border, not the inland portion), Mississippi, and Menominee. We did not include out of state features that flow into these rivers because 1) we are not as interested in attributing these large rivers and 2) there would be a substantial number of additional out-of-state features that would need to be obtained in order to attribute these rivers. The database only has base attribution and channel-level attribution for these features.",
