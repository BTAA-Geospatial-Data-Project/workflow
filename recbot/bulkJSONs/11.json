"dc_description_s": "The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on the NHD, go to http:\/\/nhd.usgs.gov\/index.html. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http:\/\/nhd.usgs.gov\/wbd.html.",

To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",

"dc_description_s": "Ohio EPA Division of Drinking and Ground Waters maintains the Ambient Ground Water Monitoring Network as part of an effort to characterize general water quality conditions in Ohio. This program was established in 1967 to measure seasonal and annual water quality changes in the state's major aquifers. The network initially consisted of 12 large production wells, and was expanded to 60 wells in 1972. In 1986, the network was further expanded to around 90 wells. A large number of public water supply wells were added to the network in the late 1980s and early 1990s to provide better representation of the major aquifers in Ohio.The program currently includes over 200 wells (stations). Of the total stations, roughly 85 percent are public water systems and 15 percent are industrial or commercial enterprises or residential. Raw water is analyzed for a suite of inorganic parameters every six, 18, or 36 months depending on the total number of samples that have been collected and the stability of the geochemistry of major elements at the site. Samples are also analyzed for volatile organic compounds once every 18 or 36 months. Some ambient sites have historical semi-volatile organic compounds and pesticide data.",

"dc_description_s": "The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination. To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",

"dc_description_s": "Ohio EPA\u2019s ground water protection requirements for voluntary cleanups are designed to address risks to residents and the environment posed by contaminated ground water. Many of these properties are located in highly urbanized areas which rely on community water systems to supply residents with safe drinking water. In those areas, ground water that contains chemicals from prior industrial or commercial activities poses no perceptible risk to the community because the ground water is not being used and will not be used for drinking water purposes in the foreseeable future. In these situations, an\u00a0Urban Setting Designation (USD)\u00a0may be appropriate.\u00a0A USD recognizes that cleaning up the ground water to drinking water standards is not necessary because no one will be drinking the ground water. Other possible exposures to contaminated ground water (such as exposures to wildlife or streams in the area, or volatilization of contaminants to indoor air) still must be addressed even when a USD is granted for an area. USDs can be granted only by the director of Ohio EPA. The request must successfully demonstrate the property (or properties) meets all the criteria of a USD as specified in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 3745-300-10 before such a designation can be granted.\u00a0The use of a urban setting\u00a0\u00a0designation (USD) to establish ground water response requirements for\u00a0\u00a0a property undergoing a voluntary action is contingent upon the following: Verification that the boundaries of the property undergoing the voluntary action lie completely within the USD area; and verification that no significant change of circumstances has occurred that would affect the criteria upon which the USD is approved at the time of the issuance of a no further action letter for the property, in accordance with OAC 3745-300-10(C)(3) and this letter.

Surface casing is always required through unconsolidated surficial deposits, whose depths are known from other mapping projects. All information has been compiled and mapped digitally for ease of distribution and future updating. Industry will be able to use these maps and data to correctly estimate the length and cost of casing required for each well prior to submitting a permit application.

The resultant data are being used to produce structure contour maps on the base of the lowest mappable, consolidated (i.e., bedrock) unit designated as a USDW. Surface casing is always required through unconsolidated surficial deposits, whose depths are known from other mapping projects. All information has been compiled and mapped digitally for ease of distribution and future updating. Industry will be able to use these maps and data to correctly estimate the length and cost of casing required for each well prior to submitting a permit application. The DOGRM will be able to directly import the data and maps to their computer applications and use it to establish required casing depths on permit applications.",

"dc_description_s": "Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program - Also known as Wellhead Protection and Drinking Water Source Protection, the Source Water Assessment and Protection (SWAP) program helps public water suppliers protect sources of drinking water (streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and aquifers) from contamination. The SWAP program addresses more than 4,500 public water systems in Ohio. It does not address private residential water systems. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA) - the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake. For more information on the SWAP Program, visit\u00a0http:\/\/epa.ohio.gov\/ddagw\/swap.aspx, send an email to\u00a0mailto:whp@epa.ohio.gov or call (614) 644-2752 and ask to speak with one of the Drinking Water Source Protection staff.\u00a0Data updated daily at midnight.\u00a0",

The sites are primarily solid waste disposal sites, including municipal solid waste, industrial solid waste, residual solid waste, and construction and demolition debris. Some sites with hazardous waste are also included. The types of sites may include licensed landfills, landfills that existed prior to state regulatory programs, exempt waste sites, unauthorized dumps, open dumps, and disposal lagoons. Some sites in the database may have been partially or fully remediated and may no longer contain significant amounts of waste.\u00a0The data are incomplete and are still in development.  New locations will be added and existing locations may be corrected.  This file does not include all sites regulated by Ohio EPA under other regulatory programs (e.g. there are many sites regulated under programs such as hazardous waste sites, surface water, \"brownfields\", etc. that are not included in this dataset).\u00a0Data were developed from Ohio EPA archival files. The accuracy of the locations depends on the available information. Where possible, points were located on the actual waste unit, or within the tax parcel boundary where the waste was said to be located. Some points were located using coordinates or descriptive text in field notes, inspection reports, etc.  In some cases, the best available information is the nearest intersection or an address. When possible the data were compared against local tax maps to improve the accuracy of the locations. Additional sources of information included but were not limited to newspaper archives, solid waste district plans, pollution inventories, historical societies, and local governments.\u00a0The information used in this dataset come from files that date back to the late 1960s and may not represent the current site conditions. The data includes only that known to Ohio EPA's solid waste regulatory program and may not include sites that were under past authority of other regulatory agencies such as local health departments.\u00a0",

General Overview\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 To assist users in their review of the legislative district plan, the plan geography is being provided in different formats. These include a geographic data file known as a shape file and a tabular data file known as an assignment file. The geographic file includes the boundaries for each district.

Geographic Database\u00a0 The underlying geographic database used to create plans for legislative districts was developed by the Urban Center at Cleveland State University (CSU) in conjunction with the Voinovich Center at Ohio University (OU) as part of the project to develop the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database (OCURD). CSU was selected by bipartisan action by the co-chairs of the Ohio Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment and Demographic Research. The lowest level of geography in this database is not the census block but the split census block.\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 The overall purpose of the project was to accommodate for the fact that many census blocks contain portions of multiple higher levels of geography, such as a precinct or a municipality. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018split\u2019 units because they did not nest into the higher levels of geography. The project also enabled the creation of geographic layers for wards (which were not part of the census geographic products) and precincts that more closely reflect the boundaries used in the 2008 and 2010 elections.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 To create a geographic system that allowed for topological integrity, the OCURD project used the boundaries of the higher levels of geography as overlays and assigned the underlying census block, or portions thereof, to each of the higher levels. When the higher level geography crossed the census block, a new geographic unit was created known as a split block. It is this \u2018block split\u2019 layer of geography that was the lowest level of geography from which the legislative districts were created.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Another goal of the OCURD project was to estimate the population in each portion of the split blocks. The project researched several means by which this could be accomplished and chose a method based upon the length of the streets in each such block. Because the population was estimated for each portion, the number of persons was not rounded to a whole person and thus some fractional numbers will be found.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Another issue arose as the OCURD database was being used by the Joint Secretaries of the Ohio Apportionment Board to create legislative plans. This issue relates to the fact that many of the higher levels of geography, notably municipalities, wards, and precincts, contain multiple pieces of territory that are separated by distances short and long. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018non-contiguous areas\u2019 (NCA) because there is some other land or water between the pieces. There are two types of NCAs: those that are not contiguous because they are islands surrounded by water and those that are not contiguous because they are legally or technically a portion of a geographic unit but surrounded by other land-based geographic units. Examples of the first type are the islands off the coast of Lake Erie. Examples of the second type abound in the state.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 In most cases, the multi-part units are combined for geographic representation in GIS software. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018shapes\u2019 and are assigned to a district as one unit, even though there may be separate estimates of population for the blocks that comprise the higher level unit. Because they are combined as an entire shape they can only be assigned to one district by the GIS software used for the redistricting phase of the apportionment process. The software used by the Board to undertake this process was Maptitude for Redistricting (MTR) by Caliper Corporation.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 Requirements of the Ohio Constitution relate to both creating districts from contiguous territory and the maintenance of political subdivision boundaries. Therefore, making use of a multi-part area as the boundary of a district could present a situation in which a political subdivision would be split and a district would be created using non-contiguous territory.\u00a0 7.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever the geographic representation of the GIS software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definition as adopted by the Apportionment Board. 8.\u00a0\u00a0 Because some areas in the higher geographic levels are multi-part units the software flagged some districts as being non-contiguous. Notes on these situations follow.\u00a0 \u00a0Part C. Notes on Specific Districts:\u00a0 The following areas include districts that were designated by the Maptitude software as having some non-contiguous areas:\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 District 38\u2014Stark County. Block 391517147013085 is split into two pieces including portions of precincts 151ANY &amp; 151AEB. The portion in 151ANY contains no population and is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 District 46\u2014Lucas County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Jerusalem Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 District 48\u2014Stark County. Block 391517123002009 is split into three pieces including portions of precincts 151ACD, 151AME, and 151ANG. Each of these portions contains no population. The triangular portion at the lower south east of the block is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 District 55\u2014Lorain County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Avon Lake City. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 District 83\u2014Hardin and Logan Counties. There is one unit in the \u2018Block Split\u2019 layer, 390650007003086091AAR, that is unassigned in the map. It contains no population and is surrounded by district 83. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal description.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 District 88\u2014Sandusky County. One island is located in Sandusky Bay but is a portion of Riley Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.7.\u00a0\u00a0 District 89\u2014Ottawa County.

School district boundaries were created based upon voter registration records to support various initiatives across multiple state agencies. CSU, NODIS used the school district assignment on the current voter registration record to establish where the district boundaries are. The address locations of voters will be assigned to the Census Bureau's TIGER geographic database and both automated and manual procedures implemented to create the school district boundaries. In addition, the school district names were updated by comparing and reconciling the names provided on the 2001-2002 Census file with those provided in the voter registration database. In 2007, this dataset was updated for 34 counties. The school district boundaries were created from county auditor supplied parcel boundary source data. The parcel boundaries were dissolved on tax district ids to form school district polygons. The resulting polygons were then conflated to centerline, railroad, hydrography, and political boundary data to form a complete school district layer covering the entire county. The data set was last updated in 2014.",

It is the excel file under the Documents section titled \u201cProperty SOV.\u201d Since coverage is not required in non-state buildings, our SOV will only included leased locations that the agencies requested be added to the insurance. DAS Office of Real Estate can probably give a full list of leased locations. The agencies are currently certifying their data for the July 1st renewal. They are supposed to have all of their changes made by April 6th. I can send you an update at that time, if that will help. You will notice that some locations have records for multiple agencies, since we are now required by our carrier to specify contents and equipment values for each entity within the state building. Those records will show a $0 value for the building except for the building owner. We also have added underground tanks and pipes when the agency requests coverage for them.",
