"dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents tax parcels for Brown County, Wisconsin in 2015. It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Brown_Parcels_2015.gdb. [TaxParcel depicts parcels of land as polygon features. Attributes include ParcelType, ParcelID, LegalLabel, MapAreaTxt, CSM, Lot, Municipality and more. The ParcelType is a subtype code which indicates whether a parcel polygon is a regular Tax Parcel or if it's a Condominium. Condominiums are currently mapped as overlapping (stacked) polygons so that a 1:1 join can be used to link up tax assessment records with the parcel. For other areas of land where records are ambiguous and ownership is uncertain, ParcelType may show Gap, Overlap or Undetermined. In some areas, private roadways, public road rights-of-way, and railroad rights-of-way are also coded. ParcelID is the parcel identification number which can be used to relate or join the TaxParcel polygon to assessment records and other information. In the GeoDatabase version of this dataset, the ParcelID is set up as a 1:M Relate to various tables within the geodatabase to link ownership, tax information, assessment, and more. LegalLabel depicts the document of record that CREATED or MODIFIED the shape of the parcel (this document reference does NOT necessarily show the latest document of record (the latest document of record number is instead obtained through the joined\/related table in the DocID field). The document numbers on the LegalLabel as well as the DocID number in the related table can be used to look up the deed or other document recorded in the Brown County Register of Deeds office. MapAreaTxt is the size of the parcel, generally the size recorded on the plat, CSM or other legal document. The format follows that shown on the legal document (which may be square feet -- SF -- or Acreage). If the parcel was recently created using a Certified Survey Map (CSM) then that CSM number may be recorded in the ParcelPolygon attributes, which is graphically feature-linked to the CSM text annotation on the map. Lot numbers for some of the recent parcels may also be held as an attribute. The Lot Number is based on the lot shown on the source subdivision plat or CSM. Please refer to the LotNumber annotation feature class, as this text layer contains many more lot numbers. The Lot attribute field in this parcel polygon layer is primarily used to generate feature-linked text on the map for newly-created lots. Please keep in mind that lots are often split, merged and otherwise changed from their original shape and size. In these cases, the legally-recorded lot does not change in size or shape, but the TaxParcel polygon does. MashedWorld is a computed field used to view the parcel from the Google StreetView and Microsoft Virtual Earth perspectives. Created_User and Created_Date fields in TaxParcel polygons tracks the GIS editor who digitized the parcel and the date it was digitized (NOT necessarily the date the parcel was recorded!). Last_Editied_User and Date are automatic GIS data tracking fields to indicate when a parcel was modiefied on the GIS database.]",

Arc attributes include feature names and Water Body ID Codes (WBICs). The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed this statewide Hydrography geographic data layer from 1:24,000-scale sources. The 1:24K Hydrography database includes information about surface water features represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and so on. A large portion of the DNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Wetlands delineations are NOT included in the 24K Hydro data layer. Following the initial release of the 24K Hydrography database in October of 2000, a series of data updates and enhancements have culminated in Version 6 of the 24K Hydro layer, which was completed in June 2007. Version 6 includes data enhancements and corrections.]",

SHAIDs contain various descriptive attributes, including names and Water Body ID Codes (WBICs). The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed this statewide Hydrography geographic data layer from 1:24,000-scale sources. The 1:24K Hydrography database includes information about surface water features represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and so on. A large portion of the DNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Wetlands delineations are NOT included in the 24K Hydro data layer. Following the initial release of the 24K Hydrography database in October of 2000, a series of data updates and enhancements have culminated in Version 6 of the 24K Hydro layer, which was completed in June 2007. Version 6 includes data enhancements and corrections.]",

"dc_description_s": "Ayres Associates provided Wood County, Wisconsin with digital, color orthoimagery services in 2015 as part of WROC. The aerial imagery was collected on March 24th using a Microsoft Vexcel UltraCam Eagle sensor mounted in a fixed-wing aircraft. Aerial imagery was collected to support 0.5 ground sample distance (GSD) orthoimagery to meet ASPRS Class II horizontal accuracy specifications at 1' = 100' map scale. The horizontal accuracy meets or exceeds 2.0 feet RMSE using the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) standards. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to the new DEM from an existing LiDAR surface created as part of the CDBG funded WROC program. Orthoimagery was delivered in PLSS section GeoTiff and MrSID tiles and a project wide MrSID mosaic. The orthoimagery was deilvered according to a section tile schematic. The total project area is 809 sq. miles, plus a 500-ft buffer around the county boundary. Imagery collected for Wood County will additionally be used for the 2015 mapping services provided to the municipalities of Marshfield and Wisconsin Rapids. Geographic Description: Wood County is located in central Wisconsin, where the north and east parts of the county lie in the Northern Highlands region, characterized by heavily forrested lands situated at higher elevations compared to the rest of the state. Conversely, the south and west portions are in the Central Plain region, dominated by flat, marshy landscape, which provides the ideal conditions for making Wood County one of the top producers of cranberries in the state. Supplemental Information: The Wisconsin Regional Orthophotography Consortium (WROC) is a multi-entity ground led by regional planning commissions (RPCs) and WROC representatives from Ayres Associates. The goal of the consortium is to build and sustain a multi-participant program to acquire digital orthoimagery and elevation data throughout Wisconsin. Orthoimagery was collected for Wood County in 2015 to provide consistent deliverable products and accuracy standards for each of the participating entities.",

It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Wood_Hydro_YE2016.gdb.[This shapefile includes all Simple Hydro Areas (SHAIDs) in the 1:24,000-scale Hydrography data model (Version 3). SHAIDS include hydrographic features only and do not contain islands or uplands. SHAIDs contain various descriptive attributes, including names and Water Body ID Codes (WBICs). The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed this statewide Hydrography geographic data layer from 1:24,000-scale sources. The 1:24K Hydrography database includes information about surface water features represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and so on. A large portion of the DNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Wetlands delineations are NOT included in the 24K Hydro data layer. Following the initial release of the 24K Hydrography database in October of 2000, a series of data updates and enhancements have culminated in Version 3 of the 24K Hydro layer, which was completed in December 2003. Version 3 includes data enhancements and corrections.]",

All parcels are now in maintenance mode with edits occuring frequently or almost daily. Parcel data is published on a monthly basis so as to give the end user a fairly updated version of the parcels. Although the publication of the data is monthly there are areas that will be 'under construction' or incomplete due to the ongoing maintenance of the data. This feature class is most often joined with the tax roll data for publication with a different name, i.e. 'TaxDataParcels'.Those individula parcels where a clear boundary is not available from the current source documents, i.e. Condominiums, Manage Forest Law or poor descriptions, one feature is created encompassing all the area of the parcels. The parcels are then tracked in a separate table (MultiPIN) in the database and joined with the parcel feature for publication. This will then create one feature on top of the other so as to represent all tax roll records.]",

These source materials were of several different scales and were from dates ranging from the early 1850's to the present. This map provides a useful representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels and is suitable for its intended purpose. It is not, however, meant to be used for the determination of land ownership or to be in any way a substitute for the land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds. The tax parcel layer is available in a county-wide or individual layer for each township, city, or village. The current publication date is January, 1 2016.

The Washburn County Land Information Office plans to maintain this digital data in ESRI's ArcGIS 9.x geodatabase environment using ArcMap tools. Some of the data was developed using field data collection techniques and field data collection will be used extensively to maintain the data.

The purpose of the project was to identify each geographic address location within Polk County except for the cities and villages who assign their own address. A point map feature was digitized (placed) at each driveway access location that had an existing structure. The primary reference material used for this project were historical Lange Enterprises hardcopy maps located in the Division of Zoning, Department of Land Information, County of Polk, Wisconsin. Also, Polk County 1996 and 2006 aerial imagery were used for address point placement.Polk County 2006 & 2010 Aerial imagery is the primary reference material used to assign new addresses. ArcGIS Online World Imagery file is also used for reference purposes.In the year 2013, the Polk County Sheriff's Department requested that address points be added within cities and villages for reference purposes. The Department of Land Information has been placing address points in the cities and villages that are parcel mapped using the Polk County 2010 aerial image as a reference. Since Polk County doesn't assign addresses within cities and villages this data may not be accurate or complete.]",

The features included in this geodatabase are 'FARMLAND', 'GENERAL', and 'SHORELAND'. [The parcel data set delineates the tax parcels and associated annotation in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Each parcel is attributed with the County's parcel identification number (PIN). The PIN is used to relate parcels to tax listing databases. Parcel boundaries were derived from a variety of sources including GPS control, Manitowoc County digital orthophotography (DOP), an adjusted version of the WDNR LandNet, scanned\/registered tax parcel assessment sheets, legal descriptions, certified survey maps (CSMs), subdivision plats, and road centerlines and hydrology developed from DOPs. These source materials were of several different scales and were from dates ranging from the early 1930's to present. Parcels were mapped to fit within Manitowoc County's Public Land Survey System grid using coordinate geometry (COGO) or screen digitizing. (Note: The County does not map parcels in the City of Manitowoc; they are included in this dataset by permission).]",

BLRPCommission staff used aerial photography and maps to delineate and note information on land uses in the field. All field work was undertaken with two staff people to provide verification and checking of land uses in the field. All structures appearing on aerial photography were inventoried as to type of use and noted on the photography or parcel\/address map to determine location. New structures were noted on the photography or parcel\/address map located relative to other visible landmarks along with type of use. Agricultural areas were inventoried as to the extent of current agricultural activities and delineated on the photography with notes on the use of the land. Undeveloped areas were inventoried as to the extent of the area covered and the general land cover. BLRPC used standard land use codes to note land uses on the photography or parcel\/address map.

SHAIDS include hydrographic features only and do not contain islands or uplands. SHAIDs contain various descriptive attributes, including names and Water Body ID Codes (WBICs). The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed this statewide Hydrography geographic data layer from 1:24,000-scale sources. The 1:24K Hydrography database includes information about surface water features represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and so on. A large portion of the DNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Wetlands delineations are NOT included in the 24K Hydro data layer. Following the initial release of the 24K Hydrography database in October of 2000, a series of data updates and enhancements have culminated in Version 6 of the 24K Hydro layer, which was completed in June 2007. Version 6 includes data enhancements and corrections.]",
