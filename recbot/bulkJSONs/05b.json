"dc_description_s": "Since 2016, Hennepin County has organized counts at locations outside of Minneapolis, counting both pedestrians and bicyclists. These short term counts rely on volunteers collecting data over a two-hour window, from 4:00-6:00 PM during the second week of September each year. The raw data from the counts was then used to calculate estimated daily traffic (EDT) at each site, which means that 2-hour counts are extrapolated to understand larger trends in walking and biking. Hennepin County s volunteer counts take place in conjunction with the City of Minneapolis pedestrian and bicycle counts. Hennepin County leads the initiative for all counts outside of the City of Minneapolis; however, the county still utilizes data for county roads within the City of Minneapolis. This data shows the EDT for pedestrians and bicyclists at each intersection, in all directions. For more detailed information related to methodology, and the latest report, visit https:\/\/www.hennepin.us\/residents\/transportation\/walking. Link to Attribute Table Information: http:\/\/gis.hennepin.us\/OpenData\/Metadata\/PedestrianCountIntersections.pdf Data updated: annually This data (i) is furnished AS IS with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.

"dc_description_s": "The original Hennepin County Wetland Inventory (HCWI) was developed from the remote sensing of multiple years of orthophotograpy in combination with the analysis of related GIS layers and 10 years of Natural Resources Conservation Service slide reviews to identify and include farmed wetlands. The HCWI does not classify wetlands but merely locates them, whereas the NWI classifies wetlands based on the Cowardin methodology utilizing remotely gathered data and photo signature. For more information concerning detail on procedures followed to develop the HCWI contact Hennepin County Dept. of Environmental Services.National Wetland Inventory Metadata:The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) for east-central Minnesota were updated through multi-agency collaborative effort under leadership from the Minnesota DNR. Operational support for wetland mapping and classification was provided by Ducks Unlimited and support for methods development and field validation were provided by the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. Major funding was provided by the Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund.The project area consists of 13 counties in east-central Minnesota including: Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Goodhue, Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright Counties. The updated wetland inventory area included complete coverage for all USGS quarter quadrangles that intersect any of these counties (about 7,150 square miles). The NWI classification process for east-central Minnesota consisted of three basic steps: 1) creation of image segments (polygons), 2) RandomForest classification of the segments, and 3) photo-interpretation of the classified image segments. The updated NWI also contains a Simplified Plant Community Classification and a Simplified Hydrogemorphic Classification. Quality assurance of the data included a 100% visual inspection, automated checks for attribute validity and topologic consistency, as well as a formal accuracy assessment based on an independent field verified data set. Further details on the methods employed can be found in the technical procedures document for this project (provide URL). The updated NWI data are primarily based on aerial imagery acquired in 2010 and 2011 as well as other modern ancillary data. This data is intended to replace the original NWI data which was based on imagery acquired in the early 1980s. NWI data support effective wetland management, protection, and restoration. The data provide a baseline for assessing the effectiveness of wetland policies and management actions. These data are used at all levels of government, as well as by private industry and non-profit organizations for wetland regulation and management, land use and conservation planning, environmental impact assessment, and natural resource inventories.

When possible survey records such as road plans, certificates of survey and other items on file in the County Surveyor's Office are used. Where lines are not defined by plan or description, information may be digitized but this is rare. Resources are not available formaking field inspections or surveys to locate parcel boundaries or ownership. Where occurrences of gaps or overlaps are clear, they are identified. Generally gaps or overlaps under 3 feet are removed.In cases of receding shorelines, extended lot lines are shown for small changes. (Refer to SDLTXLIN explanation) When significant changes in water levels occur, extensions may not be possible and may result in ambiguity. In these cases, extended ownership lines are noted as notdefined and are terminated at previously known limits.Online link to metadata",

This includes nursing facility and boarding care beds that fall under Federal MEDICAID. Once the nursing home records were isolated, address records were cleaned for geocoding. Geocoding was performed by the Hennepin County GIS Office using composite locators. Addresses found within the metropolitan area will have a higher degree of accuracy than those throughout Minnesota. Original data was downloaded from: http:\/\/www.health.state.mn.us\/divs\/fpc\/directory\/fpcdir.html and included the following statement: Health Care Facility and Provider Database: This database offers addresses, phone numbers, administrator names and state registration or licensure status for Minnesota health care providers. Federal certification classifications are also included. Provider types in the directory are boarding care homes, home health agencies, home care providers, hospices, hospitals, housing with services, nursing homes and supervised living facilities and other non-long term care providers. Providers can be selected by type, county, city or name. The NAME field is the name for each nursing home.

A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The field PIN is the parcel ID for each parcel address. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate\/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. The point layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated.

Each geographic region will have one hub site in which all core HSPHD services will be provided or accessed, and one or more satellite sites at which specialized services will be provided. Regionalization (or decentralization) of services, along with a redesigned (and integrated) client service delivery model, will provide for easier client access to services and information, along with better client outcomes.The boundary was updated March 2014 to align with the county boundary, municipal boundaries, Minneapolis neighborhoods, and Franklin Ave. This was completed by the Hennepin County GIS Office.

The attribute table includes road names and geocoding ranges for each road feature. The associated street alias table can be joined to this dataset using the UNIQUE_ID field and the JOIN_ID field from the alias table. More recently, the dataset has been enhanced to better support routing, including the conversion of single line segments to dual carriageway for divided highways and boulevards and the addition of access ramps. Speed, elevation, and one way attributes are also provided, allowing this dataset to be built into a routable network dataset. Attribute information is defined by the MRCC standard. Information on the standard, including attribute definitions, is available on the MetroGIS MRCC project site at https:\/\/metrogis.org\/projects\/centerlines-initiative.aspx. While this dataset includes only Hennepin County roadways, it is intended to align with neighboring counties to provide a standard, multi-purpose regional street centerline dataset.

This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire fighting training academies are also included. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record dates from 01\/05\/2005 and the newest record dates from 08\/07\/2008.

The TIGER\/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File \/ Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF\/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and\/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and\/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business\/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.Link to Attribute Table Information: http:\/\/gis.hennepin.us\/OpenData\/Metadata\/2010%20Census%20Tracts.pdfData updated: 04\/08\/2011Use Limitations: This data (i) is furnished AS IS with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and\/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. A block may consist of one or more faces.Link to Attribute Table Information: http:\/\/gis.hennepin.us\/OpenData\/Metadata\/2010%20Census%20Blocks.pdfData updated: 04\/08\/2011Use Limitations: This data (i) is furnished AS IS with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian \/ Alaska Native \/ Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.Link to Attribute Table Information: http:\/\/gis.hennepin.us\/OpenData\/Metadata\/2010%20Census%20Block%20Groups.pdfData updated: 04\/08\/2011Use Limitations: This data (i) is furnished AS IS with no representation as to completeness or accuracy; (ii) is furnished with no warranty of any kind; and (iii) is not suitable for legal, engineering or surveying purposes.

Address points are generally placed near the rooftop centroid or, in the case of larger buildings, near the addressed doorway\/structure access. Most addressed structures in this feature class are convential buildings, but addresses are also sometimes assigned to: Recreational vehicles, construction trailers, and mobile homes. Permanent campsites or outdoor facilities, Outdoor sports areas, Trailhead parking lots, Gravel pits, and Telematics Communications towers. Limitations: Addresses within cities, Greenwood Township, and on reservations. The custodians of this feature class (St. Louis County 9-1-1 Communications) administer addressing in rural areas of St. Louis County, not within incorporated municipalities, American Indian Resrvations, or Greenwood Township. Therefore addresses depicted within cities (including Duluth), on reservations, and in Greenwood Township are based on secondhand information and are less likely to be current or accurate. Sub-Addresses: Although it is a future goal, this feature class does not yet contain accurate sub-addresses (i.e. 1234 Spruce Ave, Unit C).Link to metadata: http:\/\/gis.stlouiscountymn.gov\/opendata\/MasterAddressRepository.html",
