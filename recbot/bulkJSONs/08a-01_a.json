The SSURGO (Soil Survey Geographic) database is compiled at the detailed county-level survey scale that most soil information users are familiar with, and has two basic components: 1) digital boundaries of the detailed soil mapping units, and 2) tabular information on a wide range of soil parameters associated with each mapping unit. The STATSGO (State Soil Geographic) database summarizes similar soils information at a much more generalized  201csoil association 201d scale. Both of these datasets for the DRB area were downloaded from USDA 2019s  201cgeospatial data 201d site at http:\/\/datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov. Once downloaded, considerable effort was then expended to first \\r\\nseam together the data from the separate states overlapping the DRB, and then to  201cpopulate 201d both soil databases by linking a number of  201cattribute tables 201d to the soils polygons contained within the DRB boundary. In this case, over 325,000 soil polygons were populated with information extracted from about a dozen different attribute tables.",

"dc_description_s": "To better understand how the land is changing and to relate those changes to water quality trends, the USGS funded the production of a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series (CBLCD) representing four dates: 1984, 1992, 2001, and 2006. These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.",

"dc_description_s": "To better understand how the land is changing and to relate those changes to water quality trends, the USGS funded the production of a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series (CBLCD) representing four dates: 1984, 1992, 2001, and 2006. These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976). The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties. The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed. MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer. MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values. MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation. For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture). Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture. The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.",

Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. This project consists of the creation of 3-band, 24 bit color digital orthophoto tiles for the 5-county, Pennsylvania portion DVRPC's region utilizing a Leica ADS40 digital imaging system. The tiles were delivered in both GeoTIFF and MrSID MG3 formats. A GeoTIFF is a TIFF file which has geographic (or cartographic) data embedded as tags within the TIFF file. The geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and geometry within a geographic information system (GIS) display. MrSID (Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database) is a proprietary, wavelet-based, image compression file format (*.sid) developed and patented by LizardTech, Inc. A 20:1 compresssion ratio was used for the MrSIDs. The complete data set contains 1,540 full ortho tiles in Pennsylvania State Plane South coordinate system, NAD83. The individual tiles measure 5,055' x 8,745' at a 1.0' pixel size. There is no image overlap between adjacent tiles. Orthoimagery processed by BAE Systems.",

These bike racks are in the style of 'staple' or 'hoop' racks. The PPA racks are those mounted to the former parking meter posts. They are the green discs that have been installed through Center City and parts of University City. The PROJECT field defines the associated project of installation, either Adopt-a-rack or PPA. The STAND_ADD field is most appropriate for address locating or geocoding purposes. Please note the field NUM_RACKS represents the number of racks at a given address.

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and the resulting limitations of these data. The National Land Cover Dataset was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The Pennsylvania portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping activities for Federal Region III that includes the States of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium.

One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives.

"dc_description_s": "The National Land Cover Database 2001 land cover layer for mapping zone 47 was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered 'provisional' until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http:\/\/www.mrlc.gov\/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 47 encompasses whole or portions of several states, including the states of Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 47 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the National Center, EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.",

The purpose of the TMDL program is to identify sources of pollution and allocate pollutant loads in places where water quality goals are not being achieved. This layer shows the list of waters for which technology-based or other required pollution controls are not stringent enough to meet water quality standards. The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources. This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them. Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation. This layer is based on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).",

The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data are representative of the time period 2003-2007. The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use\/Land Cover system, where the more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value. Further the coding is hierarchial so that each group can be related to other codes within a general category. For example, in the Anderson system the general classification of forest is a 4, a deciduous forest is 41, and so on. For a description of the Anderson system see; http:\/\/landcover.usgs.gov\/pdf\/anderson.pdf This project was funded by The PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR)",

This file was created by merging three small watershed datasets; (1) Smallsheds from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP); (2) Maryland Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 14 digit watersheds; (3) 1:24,000 scale watersheds from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). Pennsylvania watersheds are delineated at 1:24,00 while New York and Maryland watersheds are delinated mostly at 1:24,000 but some were delineated at larger or smaller scale. Additionally, the boundary between the Upper Susq. and Chemung Subbasins was updated to match the SRBC delineated subbasin line that exists on 1:24,000 scale USGS topographic maps.",

"dc_description_s": "Multiple TIFF and layer files pertaining to Landscape ecological assessment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors.

Important in preserving heritage and traditional values, cultural lands often define sense of place. The objective of the cultural assessment is to identify lands that provide cultural assets and further inform preservation efforts with spatial information about cultural lands. This spatial information about cultural resources can provide an added value to land preservation because cultural lands provide a historic perspective for interpreting land and people's relationship with it. Additionally, the value of an historic or cultural site is often intrinsically tied to the landscape context in which it is located.

"dc_description_s": "Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at 1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having 20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned using published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New scale-enhanced understanding of topographic\/geologic patterns in the Appalachian Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc\/Info. The late Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional work. A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries. The dataset has been attributed with the county names.",

"dc_description_s": "Land Recycling Cleanup Location Land Recycling Cleanup Locations (LRCL) are divided into one or more sub-facilities categorized as media: Air, Contained Release or Abandoned Container, Groundwater, Sediment, Soil, Surface Water, and Waste. Media is the environmental resource that is associated with the cleanup effort. The following primary facility kinds describe the Acts from which cleanup locations are derived: Act2 Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards The first declaration of Section 102 of the policy provides a brief description of the purpose of Act2: The elimination of public health and environmental hazards on existing commercial and industrial land across this Commonwealth is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation, and open-space areas. The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure. CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding Evaluate damages to natural resources HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act [This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners. Other The Other primary facility kind includes a mixture of various different cleanup sites, no further action sites, and potential sites. This is optional data that the regional offices are not required to maintain. STSP Storage Tank Spill and Prevention Act Releases and\/or ruptures from improperly installed or faulty storage tanks contaminate the Commonwealth's land and water resources. This act was passed to prevent such contamination through 'improved safeguards on the installation and construction of storage tanks.'",

"dc_description_s": "High resolution land cover dataset for Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass\/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for this dataset was 9.84 ft2. The primary data sources used to derive this land cover layer include NAIP Digital Orthophotos and an nDSM, both of which were provided by Lancaster County. Ancillary vector data layers (Buildings, Driveways, Parcels, Parking, Railroads, Roads, Utility Lines, Water) also helped guide classification and were provided by Lancaster County. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2010. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using high resolution raster and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment, a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color\/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to ensure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. This data has not been subject to quality assurance and control therefore errors exist from the automated processes.",

"dc_description_s": "Edge of Pavements are the edges of all public thoroughfares including paved roads, unpaved roads, bridges, overpasses, tunnels, alleys, stairways and airfield runways. Paved Roads are roads that are surfaced with concrete or asphalt. Roads that have been tarred and chipped are also considered paved. Roads surfaced with gravel or packed dirt are considered Unpaved. An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than surrounding roads that runs between, but parallel to, two paved roads. An Alley can be either paved or unpaved. Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways. Road pavement edges that are underneath bridges or overpasses are coded as Hidden. Bridges and Overpasses are delineated along the outside edge of the structure. Portions of bridges that are under other bridges or other objects are coded as Hidden Bridge. Tunnels are shown as lines connecting the apparent width of the tunnel through the earth. Stairways are major pedestrian thoroughfares, either paved or wooden, connecting two (2) roads and typically found on steep hills. Airfield Runways are the edges of Runways, Taxiways and other airfield pavement areas. Driveways that are greater than 300' in length will be digitized and coded as either Paved Road or Unpaved Road. Paved Road edges show the width of the paved area. If the paved road has a paved shoulder, the paved shoulder is shown as part of the paved road. The placement of an unpaved road is subject to interpretation by the photogrammetrist since the road edge may be indefinite due to the imprecise nature of an unpaved surface. Driveways that are over 300' in length are digitized. For a driveway that terminates at a building, it shall be drawn to the building. Driveways will also have a centerline for its entire length. Parking lots are not digitized. The entrance to a parking lot for shopping areas shall be shown. Driving areas around and through parking lots serving shopping areas and other businesses are considered part of the parking lot. If the driving area through a parking lot connects to two (2) or more exterior roads, the main thoroughfare through the parking lot shall be shown as a road. The driving area through an apartment complex or condominium complex shall be digitized as a road. The road is needed in these areas to show access to the individual dwelling places. Edges of Pavement that are updated will have the database field StreetCL_FC populated with the Feature Code of the Street Centerline. (The Street Centerline Feature Code is more descriptive than the general code used for Edge of Pavement.)",

"dc_description_s": "Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Prepared for Philadelphia2035, the Citys comprehensive development plan, to support the zoning reform remapping and the District Planning projects. For more information on the Philadelphia2035 comprehensive planning process, see www.phila2035.org Land use classifications are activity-based. Each land unit has only one land use designation interpreted by a 1, 2 or 3-digit code. Specificity of a land use description increases from the one to three digit code. Example: 1= Residential, 1.2 = Residential Medium Density, and 1.2.1 = Residential Rowhouse.Land use features are derived from Philadelphia Water Department tax parcel boundaries (2009 to current release date) and from other GIS datasets prepared by City departments including: planimetric features, transportation right-of-ways (ROW), parks and open space, and water. Land use boundaries are typically coincident with PWD tax parcel boundaries, where tax parcel boundaries are available to define units of land. In some cases multiple land activities on a single parcel and been individual represented as individual polygons of land use. This land use feature class is under revision through 2014. Updates will be made to correct attributes and features and to populate 3-digit codes based upon field verifications made by PCPC staff. Land use field surveys will be conducted for each of the 18 Planning District beginning in 2011 as part of the Philadelphia2035 Compressive Planning process. For areas not yet updated by a Planning District field survey, land use designations are qualified estimates derived from the Office of Property Assessment data (see details under Development Process below).",

"dc_description_s": "Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts\/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to connect image analysis of the area to ecological assessment of tree cover change trends over the last 15 years. In addition, AMERICAN FORESTS created a 'green data layer' -a digital tool that local communities can use to integrate urban forest ecology into their future planning. Frankford Tacony, Mill Creek and Cobbs Creek in Pennsylvania and the Big Timber in New Jersey were selected for analysis and to create a detailed (4-meter resolution) digital landcover. The detailed analysis used a high-resolution satellite image as the basis for creating a 'green data layer' or classified land cover image. This digital mapping tool enables planners to integrate green infrastructure into their future planning.",

"dc_description_s": "A newly revised version of the historic USGS 15 minute topographic maps for Pennsylvania as collected from the MapTech Historical Map Collection at 'http:\/\/historical.maptech.com'. As an improvement to the initial version, the original scanned images from MapTech were downloaded, assembled with mosaicing software, and georeferenced to the statewide Albers NAD83 projection. Historic USGS 15 minute topographic maps for Pennsylvania as collected from the MapTech Historical Map Collection at 'http:\/\/historical.maptech.com'. Scanned map images from MapTech were downloaded, assembled, and registered and rectified via Arc\/Info to a custom Albers NAD83 projection. The name of the map file will tell you the 15 minute quadrangle, the two letter abbreviation of the state is mostly in and the year it references. Another key point to remember is that through the decades some of the 15 minute USGS quads have changed names. Some examples include the following groups: (Alburtis-Allentown West-Slatington), (Dingmans Ferry-Wallpack), and (Lehighton-Mauch Chunk). On most average monitors the maps look best at a scale of 1:25,000 to 1:30,000.",

The map has 17 cover classses modified from the Anderson Level II system. Landsat remotely sensed data and additional thematic data bases were used to create the map. A decision-tree classification was used, together with ad hoc algorithms to improve local accuracies. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were acquired for three seasons. The spatial accuracy is nominally 30m, but accuracy increases rapidly at larger minimum mapping units and, as a general rule, the map should not be used below 1ha (100m x 100m) resolution. The map extends beyond the watershed but has not been validated outside the watershed boundary and the intersecting counties.",

Then click the 'View Regions & Blocks' link, select a block, click its 'Block Map' tab and choose whether to print an air photo or a topo map. This site can be used to help you find the particular 2nd PBBA block where you live or where you make any of your breeding bird observations. You can zoom directly to a point by entering a latitude and longitude. Be sure to use decimal degree format and always include a minus (-) sign before the longitude. Or, you can type in a street address. Be sure to enter both the address and the associated zip code. When you click 'Refresh Map,' the point or address you entered will be shown as a yellow circle on the map within the Atlas block, which is outlined with green lines and identified with a small number, such as 62B43. The ability to locate 2nd PBBA blocks for a specific lat\/long is very helpful, for example, if you have been hiking or boating through an area covering several Atlas blocks, all the while collecting waypoints to go along with breeding bird sightings that you make. It can even help if you're completely lost somewhere in the state but not too panic-stricken to keep atlassing!",

"dc_description_s": "This point dataset represents an (incomplete) inventory of karst features (herein categorized as sinkholes, surface depressions, surface mines, or cave entrances) that have been cataloged in Pennsylvania by the staff of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey since 1985. County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publicatons. Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set. Karst features change considerablely over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem. Development obliterates much of the evidence for underlying karst features.",

Omernik's ecoregions are based on the premise that a hierarchy of ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of both living and nonliving phenomena, such as geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology, that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity. All the characteristics are considered when determining ecoregions, but the relative importance of each characteristic may vary from one ecoregion to another. Level III is the most detailed level available nationally for this system of ecoregions.",

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance. Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners. The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included. Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included. Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county. Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants. It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, but not necessarily earned during the year. Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county. The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation. All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.

Divisions represent the climates within domains and are differentiated based on precipitation levels and patterns as well as temperature. Divisions are subdivided into provinces, which are differentiated based on vegetation or other natural land covers. The finest level of detail is described by subregions, called sections, which are subdivisions of provinces based on terrain features.

The first stream segment flows from the headwaters to the first tributary. Subsequent segments are tributary to tributary. The final segment flows from the last tributary to the mouth which for purposes of this data layer is defined as the point at which the stream crosses the Pennsylvania boundary. The unique segment identifier is constructed from three concatenated fields. The stream code, downstream river mile, and finally the upstream river mile of the segment boundaries (12345_8.000_ 12.000).

"dc_description_s": "This is a county wide analysis of Berks County waterways to determine riparian buffer values given a 50 ft., 50% canopy coverage requirement. The analysis was done by first overlaying the stream shapefile on the orthophotos. Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added. Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile. The canopy coverage percentage was interpeted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement. At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none). - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream. - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage. The threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft. If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines. Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline. In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides. Ponds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis. Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value. Edits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious. The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes. The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines. Stream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value. Ten sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007. Source Data: Streamlines - The streamlines were obtained from the Berks County Planning Commission in draft form for the analysis. 2004 Orthophotos - The orthophotos were provided by the Berks County Planning Commission. The following is the metadata for the orthophotos: 'An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 1-foot pixel resolution. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator 'PA', and the State Plane zone designator 'S'. This dataset consists of 10000' x 10000' uncompressed natural color (24-bit) GeoTIFF files with ESRI world files and MrSid compression format at a pixel resolution of 1'. Digital orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Digital orthophotography is a process which converts aerial photography from an original photo negative to a digital product that has been positionally corrected for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation. The imagery was captured at a negative scale of 1:19200 for the purpose of producing orthophotos.'",

Three classes of forest patches were derived: 1) small, 2) medium, and 3) large. A customized algorithm using object-based image analysis techniques within the eCognition software package was to divide the tree canopy into the forest patch classes based on a combination of a combination of size, edge to perimeter ratio, length, and width. In general, small patches represent individual trees or small rows of trees. Medium patches represent clumps of trees, often in suburban or agricultural settings, that are fragmented and may or may not have a duff layer. Large forest patches consist of forested stands that in most cases will have a duff layer.End users of this layer should note that this forest patch classification is one approach and the dataset should be evaluated so as to understand its capabilities and limitations before using for decision making purposes.",

A customized segmentation algorithm within an object-based image analysis system was used to divide the tree canopy into homogenous polygons based on the spatial and spectral qualities in 2010-2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Each polygon was then assigned to the dominant forest type found in the National Forest Type Dataset.End users of this product should exercise caution when making decisions based on this dataset. The National Forest Type Dataset has known accuracy issues, and these issues are likely compounded when the data were reworked into this higher-resolution product.",

It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

"dc_description_s": "This data set represents Prime Agricultural Soils as defined by the County of Chester. The designation equates to any soil map unit designation as 1 or 2 in the Nonirrigated Capability Class from the SSURGO data base. The SSURGO data set is a digital soil survey and is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was collected by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. The SSURGO data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a full county format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. Sometimes a special soil features layer (point and line features) is included. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The data set has been provided to Chester County Departments and PASDA as an ArcView shapefile by the County of Chester, Department of Computer and Information Services. The theme has been reprojected to PA Stateplane NAD83 from its original datum in accordance with the base map standards of the County of Chester. The County of Chester serves as the secondary organization in providing this shapefile, as compared to its originator and primary organization, the Natural Resources Conservation Service.",

"dc_description_s": "This coverage represents the point locations and data for 1,106 groundwater quality monitoring points sampled under the PA DEP Fixed Station Network (FSN) and Ambient Survey groundwater monitoring program. Sample data were collected from August 1985 to December 1998. Monitoring points were typically homeowner wells, springs, public water supplies, or industrial wells. Locations were chosen to represent regional background conditions within a groundwater basin. Samples were collected by prioritized groundwater basins. Monitoring points represent some of the top 100 priority basins of the 478 groundwater basins. Monitoring points were analyzed for 27 different analytes including pH, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphorus, total organic carbon, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, silica, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, zinc, mercury, and turbidity. Data for alkalinity through silica are in mg\/L, whereas values listed for arsenic through mercury are in ug\/L. Turbidity is in NTUs. PH is a laboratory pH value. Analyte values listed with the coverage are means. Monitoring points have been sampled up to 34 times. Trend analysis results are included for 474 monitoring points by parameter. The Kendall Tau rank correlation test was used to test for trends in ground water quality over time. This test is a nonparametric procedure that is similar to the standard correlation coefficient to assess the presence of a relationship between variables. The Kendall Tau value represents a probability that there is a relationship between two variables. A significance level of .05 was used with the calculated Kendall Tau correlation coefficients. Trend analysis was performed on monitoring points using SAS statistical software.",

The main population centers within the study area are Birmingham, Alabama; Buffalo, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Roanoke, Virginia. The main Interstates are I-20, I-24, I-40, I-59, I-64, I-65, I-66, I-70, I-71, I-75, I-76, I-77, I-78, I-79, I-80, I-81, I-83, I-84, I-87, I-88, and I-90. The Ohio, Susquehanna, Allegheny, Tennessee, Coosa, Delaware, New, Potomac, and Scioto Rivers and their tributaries drain the area.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2008, by 2030 U.S. electricity production will need to increase by nearly 30 percent to meet growing demand. Currently, wind, solar and biomass supply 2.3% of our nation's electricity. While these renewable sources currently make up only a small fraction of energy production, renewable energy production is expected to increase by more than 70% between 2006 and 2030. Identifying and using land located in areas with high quality renewable energy resource will be an essential component of developing more electricity from renewable energy sources.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian \/ Alaska Native \/ Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011",

The SpectraPlex process takes multiple bands of original image data and compresses them to 255 cluster units using isodata as a cluster mechanism. The result of the process is an image layer of cluster numbers with an accompanying table of band means by cluster number. Color rendition: the shade set is LANDSCOP Portrayal (landscape directed spectral composite portrayal). Total of the visible bands is blue, total of the infrared bands is green, total of all bands modified to help distinguish conifers is red. The images have been converted to ArcInfo Grid coverages, exported and transferred to compact disk. The original SpectraPlex images are approximately 54 megabytes and extend over the Pennsylvania borders. The images on the Terrabyte Images cd-rom have been clipped to the borders of Pennsylvania and cut by county in Pennsylvania. Data tables include the following fields: Histogram (cell count) Class_Names: Water, Confer (coniferous forest), MixFor (mixed forest), Bdlffor (broadleaf forest), VegPlex (vegetation stages), AnnHerb (annual herbacies), PerHerb (perennial herbaceous), TerUnVeg (terrestrial unvegetated) Opacity Cosgray (gray code for cluster number) (composite or total brightness scale for visible bands) Band1 (blue 0.45 - 0.52 micrometers) Band2 (green 0.52 - 0.60 micrometers) Band3 (red 0.63 - 0.69 micrometers Band4 (photoinfrared 0.70 - 0.90 micrometers) Band5 (infrared 1.55 - 1.75 micrometers) Band6 (infrared 2.08 - 2.35 micrometers) Br123 (composite brightness scale for green, red, & first infrared bands) Br234 Br456 (composite brightness scale for infrared bands) Br1...6 (composite brightness scale for all 6 bands) BrVIN (vegetation index brightness scale) SpCls (condensed plexes or spectral groupings of original plexes) SpClGry (gray code for superclusters, stepped in order of composite brightness) CAB (conifer augmented brightness) Cover (numeric code corresponding to the class names) 0 non-image 1 water 2 conifer forest 3 mixed forest 4 broadleaf forest 5 transitional vegetation 6 perennial herbaceous 7 annual herbaceous 8 barren 9 occasionally cloud",
