"dc_title_s": "OC Development Authority: Oakland County, Michigan",
"dc_description_s": "The DevelopmentAuthority polygon feature class identifies certain types of entities that encourage development\/redevelopment in designated areas. This feature class currently represents Downtown Development Authorities (DDA), Tax Increment Finance Authorities (TIFA), and Local Development Finance Authorities (LDFA); however, it will also depict Corridor Improvement Authorities (CIA) and Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (BRA) in the future. These five types of authorities have the ability to capture tax increment financing (TIF).The features were digitized using legal descriptions, parcel lists, and maps that were provided to the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal and\/or Oakland County Equalization by the authority. The key attributes are Name (official name of the authority), Type (the type of development authority), and DevelopmentPlan (yes\/no indicating if the feature represents an area that is part of a development plan and can caputre tax increment financing).Tax Increment Financing is a tool used to promote redevelopment and community improvement projects by channeling funding toward projects in targeted areas. TIF is captured from the increase of property values from a base year. Millage rates from taxing jurisdictions are applied to the increased value. The resulting tax revenue is directed to the authority, rather than the appropriate jurisdiction.Beginning in 1994, taxing jurisdictions have the option to opt out of having its taxes captured by the authority. Also since 1994, school taxes may no longer be captured unless they are necessary to make payments on existing eligible obligations. For more information about TIF, see Michigan Department of Treasury's Tax Increment Financing FAQ web page at http:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/treasury\/0,1607,7-121-3218---F,00.html. The State of Michigan has adopted enabling legislation to allow TIF through five types of authorities. Each type of authority has a focus relating to development\/redevelopment: Downtown Development Authority (PA 197 of 1975)'Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districts Tax Increment Finance Authority (PA 450 of 1980)Prevent urban deteriorationEncourage economic development and activityEncourage neighborhood revitalization and historic preservationClosed to new applicants since 1987Allows the development of virtually any type of land use Local Development Finance Authority (PA 281 of 1986)Encourage local developmentPromote conditions of employmentPromote economic growthLimited to business activities involving:ManufacturingAgricultural processingHigh-technology activitiesEnergy productionBusiness incubators Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (PA 381 of 1996)Promote revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain propertyFocus on tax reverted, blighted, or functionally obsolete propertyMDEQ must approve brownfield redevelopment areas Corridor Improvement Authority (PA 281 of 2005)Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districtsMust be adjacent to a road classified as an arterial or collectorThese quasi-public entities are created by resolution through a community's governing body. CIA and LDFA boundaries may cross municipal boundaries. In the case of these multi-jurisdictional authorities, both communities must pass resolutions establishing authority. There is currently only one Joint LDFA (Cities of Southfield and Troy) and there are no CIAs in Oakland County. When the community establishes the authority, it must also define the geographic boundaries in which it will operate. DDAs and CIAs are authorized to levy and collect taxes through a special assessment on all properties within the authority boundary.After the authority and its boundaries are established, the authority creates a tax increment financing and development plan. The plan estimates the amount of tax increment financing that will be captured and lists specific projects on which it will be spent. It also defines the development area where the tax increment financing and projects will occur. The development area must be completely within the authority boundary; however, it may be coincident with the authority boundary.An authority may contain multiple development areas, each with its own development and tax increment financing plan. BRAs normally designate development areas as a one or two parcels for a specific development project, while the other types of authorities define development areas as a larger area. Also, LDFAs are only allowed to capture TIF from parcels in a permitted use, such as manufacturing.There may be both eliglible and inelgible parcels within a development area; however, the inelgible parcels do not participate in TIF capture. The base year used to calculate the amount of tax increment financing is set when the development plan is adopted. If the development plan is expanded at a later date, the base year could be reset for the entire development area or the capture could be calculated using multiple base years.The source for the base year was the tax billing code used by Oakland County Equalization. When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford'Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and\/or map.For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.The data will be updated on an as needed basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments. In particular, county departments may not be aware of BRA development projects when no TIF is captured. Lastly, because the tax parcel feature class is revised periodically and it is important for the features to be coincident with the tax parcel feature class, the development authority feature class will also be updated annually to correct conflicts due to parcel shifting.",

Key attributes include: GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page.This purpose of this data is general planning purposes and cartographic output. This data can also be used in conjunction with the MNFI Natural Areas feature class to identify moderate to high quality natural areas that are not protected.Each easement was located through Land Access, Oakland County's public records search tool. A search was conducted to find all recorded documents where the State of Michigan is the Grantee and the document type is an Easement (EST). In the Recorded Document Profile search within Land Access, three separate searches were performed to identify state recorded conservation easements: - State of Mi was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Michigan Dep was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Department was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. The legal description was used to identify the general location of the easement.Most often, these easements are created within a new residential development and may contain multiple conservation areas. In these cases, the point was placed in a general location within the subdivision to represent all the areas described in the conservation easement. The attribute information (i.e., GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page) was also collected through Land Access.Once complete, the dataset was verified internally and checked against information obtained from the Michigan Department of Environment Quality. We contacted David R. Dortman from the Land and Water Management Division who provided a list of the easements the state had record of. The list contained the Grantor, Liber, Page, and Acreage.",

Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2009. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2009 version of land use was created using the 2008 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space.

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2007. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2007 version of land use was created using the 2006 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for the 2006 update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.

Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information.  The data was collected in 2003. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number).  Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.  The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2003 version of land use was created using the 2002 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel vacant.

Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW. Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions: There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel vacant. These parcels are listed below: 01-29-451-001 01-35-300-014 04-08-200-002 04-24-100-004 07-13-301-006 14-04-376-002 18-19-476-015 21-10-200-001 21-10-200-002",

For example, one community may have two commercial districts- Local Commerical and General Commercial. Another community may have three commercial districts- Neighborhood Commercial, Hi-Tech Office, and Retail Commercial. A wide range of uses could be included in these categories, but for the purpose of this feature class, they are all translated into Commercial\/Office. In some cases a category on community's future land use map could not be translated into a single composite category. When this occurred, areas were manually translated into the appropriate generalized category. For example, a Public Lands class on a community's map would be manually translated into the Public\/Institutional and Recreation\/Conservation composite categories.",

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2013.Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2013 version of land use was created using the 2012 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space).

Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space).

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in August 2010. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2010 version of land use was created using the 2009 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for the 2010 update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such.

"dc_description_s": "The primary purpose of this data is to be used by Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services, other County departments, and and local communities for planning purposes.  The two major uses are cartographic output and creating summaries at various spatial extents.The intent of this feature class was to provide a very general representation of a hard copy 1966 land use map.  The spatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature was limited by the intended purpose of the data.The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land use map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater than 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire county was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on the Landuse.Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the following process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was modifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were buffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from RoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two types (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent property was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County Register of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in liber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that simultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in 1966.  Major roads that intersected or were adjacent with these simultaneous conveyances were classified as Dedicated and the remainder of Major Roads were classified as a Perscriptive Easement.  The buffer distances, representing half the total Right-of-Way width, used for each road code are listed below:     Minor Road - 30 feet     Major Road (Perscriptive Easement) - 33 feet     Major Road (Dedicated) - 46.5 feet     State Highway - 46.5 feetU.S. Highway - 46.5 feet     Interstate - 60 feet feetThese Right-of-Way widths generally approximate those that actually existed in 1966 and are not intended to indicate the exact width of a specific Right-of-Way.  All areas completely surrounded by Right-of-Way such as between directions of travel of a boulevard or interstate or the area inside of a freeway interchange were manually attributed as Right-of-Way.Water features were burned in the final feature class using a modified version the of the Oakland County Waterbody feature class.  This data was modified to reflect waterbodies in 1966 using the 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.Lastly, the features that intersected community boudaries were split using the Identity tool to increase cartographic and analytic performance.",

These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.

"dc_description_s": "This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. The results of SLAMM were analyzed for specific conservation criteria for long-term planning that may help increase coastal resiliency in Maryland. The conservation criteria included areas that may support future wetland migration, wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors, high priority aquatic and terrestrial living resources, vulnerable wetland habitat, suitable hydric soils for wetland establishment and marsh-dependent breeding bird habitat. From these criteria a conservation model was developed to prioritize the most important areas for wetland adaptation. As a result the top priorities were used to create the Wetland Adaptation Areas for the Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) used in Marylands GreenPrint.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions\/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions\/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Access Control consists of linear features which specifically show the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Access Control is classified into three types, which are Full Control, Partial Control, and No Control. Roadway Access Control data is primarily used for general planning purposes, investment requirements modeling to calculate capacity and estimate type of design, in truck size and weight studies, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Access Control data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Access Control data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Access Control data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Access Control data is key to understanding the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland.Roadway Access Control data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year. This data is for the year 2016.Last Updated: 11\/2017For data information, contact the'MDOT SHA Traffic Monitoring SystemEmail:''TMS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information, contact the'MDOT SHA Geospatial TechnologiesEmail:''GIS@sha.state.md.usFor additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT):http:\/\/www.mdot.maryland.gov\/For additional information related to the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA):http:\/\/roads.maryland.gov\/Home.aspxMDOT SHA Geospatial Data Legal Disclaimer:The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of geospatial data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The purpose of the 2010 land use\/land cover data set is to provide a generalized view of how developed land has changed throughout the state, primarily capturing the conversion of resource land to development and characterizing the type of development (e. g. very low density, low density, medium density or high density residential development, commercial, industrial, institutional). Urban Land Uses: 11 Low-density residential - Detached single-family\/duplex dwelling units, yards and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family\/duplex dwelling units, with lot sizes of less than five acres but at least one-half acre (. 2 dwelling units\/acre to 2 dwelling units\/acre). 12 Medium-density residential - Detached single-family\/duplex, attached single-unit row housing, yards, and associated areas. Areas of more than 90 percent single-family\/duplex units and attached single-unit row housing, with lot sizes of less than one-half acre but at least one-eighth acre (2 dwelling units\/acre to 8 dwelling units\/acre). 13 High-density residential - Attached single-unit row housing, garden apartments, high-rise apartments\/condominiums, mobile home and trailer parks; areas of more than 90 percent high-density residential units, with more than 8 dwelling units per acre. 14 Commercial - Retail and wholesale services. Areas used primarily for the sale of products and services, including associated yards and parking areas. 15 Industrial - Manufacturing and industrial parks, including associated warehouses, storage yards, research laboratories, and parking areas. 16 Institutional - Elementary and secondary schools, middle schools, junior and senior high schools, public and private colleges and universities, military installations (built-up areas only, including buildings and storage, training, and similar areas), churches, medical and health facilities, correctional facilities, and government offices and facilities that are clearly separable from the surrounding land cover. 17 Extractive - Surface mining operations, including sand and gravel pits, quarries, coal surface mines, and deep coal mines. Status of activity (active vs. abandoned) is not distinguished. 18 Open urban land - Urban areas whose use does not require structures, or urban areas where non-conforming uses characterized by open land have become isolated. Included are golf courses, parks, recreation areas (except areas associated with schools or other institutions), cemeteries, and entrapped agricultural and undeveloped land within urban areas. 191 Large lot subdivision (agriculture) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres, with a dominant land cover of open fields or pasture. 192 Large lot subdivision (forest) - Residential subdivisions with lot sizes of less than 20 acres but at least 5 acres, with a dominant land cover of deciduous, evergreen or mixed forest. Agriculture: 21 Cropland - Field crops and forage crops. 22 Pasture - Land used for pasture, both permanent and rotated; grass. 23 Orchards\/vineyards\/horticulture - Areas of intensively managed commercial bush and tree crops, including areas used for fruit production, vineyards, sod and seed farms, nurseries, and green houses. 24 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots, holding lots for animals, hog feeding lots, poultry houses, and commercial fishing areas (including oyster beds). 241 Feeding operations - Cattle feed lots, holding lots for animals, hog feeding lots, poultry houses. 242 Agricultural building breeding and training facilities, storage facilities, built-up areas associated with a farmstead, small farm ponds, commercial fishing areas. 25 Row and garden crops - Intensively managed truck and vegetable farms and associated areas. Forest: 41 Deciduous forest - Forested areas in which the trees characteristically lose their leaves at the end of the growing season. Included are such species as oak, hickory, aspen, sycamore, birch, yellow poplar, elm, maple, and cypress. 42 Evergreen forest - Forested areas in which the trees are characterized by persistent foliage throughout the year. Included are such species as white pine, pond pine, hemlock, southern white cedar, and red pine. 43 Mixed forest - Forested areas in which neither deciduous nor evergreen species dominate, but in which there is a combination of both types. 44 Brush - Areas which do not produce timber or other wood products but may have cut-over timber stands, abandoned agriculture fields, or pasture. These areas are characterized by vegetation types such as sumac, vines, rose, brambles, and tree seedlings. Water: 50 Water - Rivers, waterways, reservoirs, ponds, bays, estuaries, and ocean. Wetlands: 60 Wetlands - Forested or non-forested wetlands, including tidal flats, tidal and non-tidal marshes, and upland swamps and wet areas. Barren Land: 70 Barren land 71 Beaches - Extensive shoreline areas of sand and gravel accumulation, with no vegetative cover or other land use. 72 Bare exposed rock - Areas of bedrock exposure, scarps, and other natural accumulations of rock without vegetative cover. 73 Bare ground - Areas of exposed ground caused naturally, by construction, or by other cultural processes. Transportation: 80 Transportation - Miscellaneous Transportation features not elsewhere classified. Last Updated: 2010",

This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. Last Updated: 1992",

The Maryland Department of Natural resources began updating the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) mapping of wetlands in Maryland in the early 1990s. This database lists the 3. 75' x 3. 75' USGS quadrangles for which 'DNR Wetlands' have been mapped. It identifies the date of source photography used to map wetlands, and the status of mapping effort. This database also gives the five-letter abbreviation used for naming 'DNR_Wetlands' files. In most cases, the first five characters are the first 'five characters' of the 'USGS 7. 5' Quad Name. ' When completed, the series will provide coverage for the entire State of Maryland.

To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1960-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1960s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 40-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2\/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. This shoreline feature class consists of twenty separate shoreline data sets, located in Anne Arundel County, compiled from various sources, and spanning 1932-2010. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shorelines were acquired online from the 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/t-sheets. html), 2) the NOAA National Shoreline data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/index. html), and 3) the NOAA Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/cusp. html). The ca. 1940 Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) shorelines were extracted in the early 1990s from Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of NOAA. MGS digitized these shorelines directly from bromide or mylar copies of the Coastal Survey maps. The ca. 1990 MGS shorelines were digitized by EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, MD in 2000. EDI extracted the shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). This shoreline feature class was created by appending the twenty individual shoreline data sets into one master shoreline feature class file, and retains the original attribute field names from the twenty input files. As such, the original attribute information for each input dataset is part of this final shoreline feature class. MGS also created seven additional attribute fields, some which are required for DSAS analysis and some of which facilitated general data management\/analysis -- DSAS_DATE, DSAS_UNC, DSAS_SRC, DSAS_DEC, DSAS_CO, DSAS_NPROJ, and DSAS_SLINF. Here is a list of the individual data sets (by source) compiled for this master shoreline feature class (all data sets clipped to county boundaries): 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data sets -- CM7202; 2) NOAA National Shoreline data sets -- CS288, MD1932A1, MD1932A2, MD1932A3, MD1932B, MD1933D, MD1933E, MD1933F, MD1934A, CS307, MD1941A1, PH6008, PH6009A, PH6609, CM7415, and CM7601; 3) MGS data sets -- 1940 and 1990 MGS shoreline; and 4) NOAA CUSP data set.

To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Prince George's County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38thStreet bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

This conflated baseline consist of two Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Process runs. The original In 2000, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal Zone Management grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland -- the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI), currently of Frederick, Md. , to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). The 2000 baseline which were not created seaward includes all Maryland shoreline areas except for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Harford and Prince George's counties currently. The newest (2015) updated baselines were created offshore (seaward) of the shorelines utilized in DSAS analysis. The baselines were created by 1) buffering at a distance of 10m around the master shoreline feature class converting the buffer polygon to a line, and erasing the landward portion of the buffer line; and 2)manually digitizing baselines up the centerline of tributaries\/rivers and other areas where baselines were needed but the buffer-created baselines did not reach.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify rates of change (erosion or accretion) along coastal and estuarine shorelines in Maryland, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), in conjunction with Towson University s Center for Geographic Information Sciences (CGIS) and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), installed and ran a computer program, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), using as input a series of digital shoreline vectors dating from 1841-1995. Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a baseline landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs, DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect. Last Updated: Unknown",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. SSURGO DownloaderClick on a watershed to get a pop-up and start the download processNo longer do you have to spend time learning about the SSURGO database structure before you can use the data. No longer do you have to figure out how to import the data into the ArcGIS system to get your job done. Use this web map to download map packages created from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) that the Esri Soils Team has extracted and prepared for immediate use in your maps and analyses. The Esri Soils Team created a map with 130 of the most useful variables in SSURGO. The data are packaged by subbasin (HUC8 from the Watershed Boundary Dataset) and are available through this web map. The SSURGO data selected for this application consist of basic descriptions of the data (from the Map Unit Feature Class and Map Unit tables), a collection of interpretations (from the MUAGGATT table), and aggregated information about the components of each map unit (Component table). We chose these data because they represent the most commonly used fields in SSURGO and many of these values serve as standard inputs to assessment and modeling processes. Included in the map package is a zip folder containing 19 layer files to symbolize the data. The layer files contain the symbology from the Soil Mobile and Web Maps Group on ArcGIS. com. To access the folder use the Extract Package tool in the Data Management Toolbox then open the folder containing the extracted map package in Windows Explorer and navigate to commondata userdata and unzip the LayerFiles. zip folder. Data from the four SSURGO tables were assembled into the single table included in each map package. Data from the component table were aggregated using a dominant component model (listed below under Component Table Dominant Component) or a weighted average model (listed below under Component Table Weighted Average) using custom Python scripts. The the Mapunit table, the MUAGATTAT table and the processed Component table data were joined to the Mapunit Feature Class. Field aliases were added and indexes calculated. A field named Map Symbol was created and populated with random integers from 1-10 for symbolizing the soil units in the map package. For documentation of the SSURGO dataset see:http:\/\/soildatamart. nrcs. usda. gov\/SSURGOMetadata. aspx. For documentation of the Watershed Boundary Dataset see: http:\/\/www. nrcs. usda. gov\/wps\/portal\/nrcs\/main\/national\/water\/watersheds\/dataset.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data. The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and\/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s). Last Updated: Unknown",

This data layer contains the Province-level physiographic subdivisions of Maryland in ArcGIS format. The file was developed from components of a detailed digital physiographic map of Maryland by James P. Reger and Emery T. Cleaves, currently in progress. Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it. The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive. Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure, rock type, geomorphic history, and topographic characteristics. Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100,000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows, in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province, Section, Region, District, Area. In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. In this file, the polygons reflect Province level subdivision. The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level. The table includes information on dominant rock types, geologic structure, topographic relief, and drainage pattern.

The polygon feature attribute table has been developed to pertain only to the Provinces level. The table includes information on dominant rock types, geologic structure, topographic relief, and drainage pattern. Last Updated: 2002",

Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7. 5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7. 5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7. 5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7. 5- by 7. 5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7. 5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete. This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details. Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data. Last Updated: 6\/6\/1998",

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and\/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. Last Updated: Unknown",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. The TW_ContactRec feature class is the official geospatial record depicting water contact recreation areas that have been assessed (for the Integrated Report (IR)) in Maryland's tidal waters. This feature class also provides information on whether the waters are designated 'bathing beaches'. Since water contact recreational waters are assessed on such a variable scale, this feature class was developed with point geometry. As a result, points represent the general location of these assessed waters. In the case of beaches, a point generally represents the center of a bathing beach. For other recreational waters the point may represent the boundary or the centroid of the assessed waters. Please be sure to review additional IR information for a better description of the spatial extent of the assessment. Disclaimer: This feature class is not an authoritative source for the location of beaches. Nor should the information contained herein be solely used by swimmers\/bathers to determine if their beach is safe for swimming. Instead, swimmers\/bathers should consult MDE's Beaches website to get more up-to-date information on the safety of swimming at beaches. This website can be accessed at: http:\/\/www. marylandhealthybeaches. org\/. In addition, swimmers\/bathers should contact their local health department for real-time updates.",
