The last mapping effort of the lowest USDW was performed in 1982. In excess of 37,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled since that date without significant updates to the mapping. Further, the 1982 mapping was hand-drawn on paper maps, which are not easily reproducible or updated. Existing water-quality data have been collected and correlated to bedrock geology. The resultant data are being used to produce structure contour maps on the base of the lowest mappable, consolidated (i.e., bedrock) unit designated as a USDW. Surface casing is always required through unconsolidated surficial deposits, whose depths are known from other mapping projects. All information has been compiled and mapped digitally for ease of distribution and future updating. Industry will be able to use these maps and data to correctly estimate the length and cost of casing required for each well prior to submitting a permit application.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. These data provide restoration value rankings and ecological attributes associated with green infrastructure gaps. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - hubs and corridors. Gaps are developed, agricultural, mined, or cleared lands within the Green infrastructure network that could be targeted for restoration. These were evaluated for their potential restoration to forest, wetland, or riparian buffers, by considering watershed condition, landscape position, local features, ownership, and programmatic considerations. Gaps with hydric soils were probably once wetlands, and could be restored as such. Reforestation of gaps along streams would not only benefit wildlife, but improve water quality and stream stability.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Harford County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Harford County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s NOAA National Shoreline data sets and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

Shoreline Situation Reports (SSR) were first generated by VIMS in the 1970s to report the condition and status of the shore lands. The SSR series were published in hardcopy on a county by county basis for each of the Tidewater Virginia localities. The reports were intended to assist planners, managers, and regulators in decisions pertaining to management of coastal areas and natural resources therein. The techniques developed for Virginia's shoreline are used to create similar reports for the Maryland shoreline. Data collected describes conditions in the immediate riparian zone, the bank, and along the shore. These data should not be used for jurisdictional permit determinations beyond providing general shoreline condition or status information. These data have not been surveyed to property boundaries.

This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. Last Updated: 1992",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1960-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1960s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 40-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2\/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. Bathymetry for Chesapeake Bay was derived from two hundred ninety-seven surveys containing 3,178,509 soundings. Thirty-five older, less accurate, overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older, less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918, thirty-seven from the 1930s, ninety-one from the 1940s, sixty- six from the 1950s, twenty-five from the 1960s, twenty-four from the 1970s, fourteen from the 1980s, and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3. 7 meters to -50. 4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0. 2 and 1. 2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7. 5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7. 5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7. 5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7. 5- by 7. 5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7. 5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete. This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details. Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data. Last Updated: 6\/6\/1998",

Since water contact recreational waters are assessed on such a variable scale, this feature class was developed with point geometry.

For other recreational waters the point may represent the boundary or the centroid of the assessed waters. Please be sure to review additional IR information for a better description of the spatial extent of the assessment. Disclaimer: This feature class is not an authoritative source for the location of beaches. Nor should the information contained herein be solely used by swimmers\/bathers to determine if their beach is safe for swimming.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Harford County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Harford County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s MGS shoreline and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Prince George's County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38thStreet bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

This conflated baseline consist of two Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Process runs. The original In 2000, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal Zone Management grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland -- the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI), currently of Frederick, Md. , to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). The 2000 baseline which were not created seaward includes all Maryland shoreline areas except for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Harford and Prince George's counties currently. The newest (2015) updated baselines were created offshore (seaward) of the shorelines utilized in DSAS analysis. The baselines were created by 1) buffering at a distance of 10m around the master shoreline feature class converting the buffer polygon to a line, and erasing the landward portion of the buffer line; and 2)manually digitizing baselines up the centerline of tributaries\/rivers and other areas where baselines were needed but the buffer-created baselines did not reach.

The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - hubs and corridors. Hubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and\/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres. Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or most natural routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions\/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions\/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2\/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

The TW_8DigitShed feature class is the official geospatial representation depicting tidal 8-digit watershed assessments as described in Maryland's 2014 Integrated Report (IR) of Surface Water Quality. In general, tidal assessments in the Chesapeake Bay are made at the salinity segment scale. However, some older assessments and impairments that are valid in 2014, still use the old 8-digit watershed boundaries. In order to accurately capture this assessment scale, this feature class was created. In general, IR assessments at tidal 8-digit watershed scale include assessments for PCBs in fish tissue and metals. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.",

This shoreline feature class consists of twenty separate shoreline data sets, located in Anne Arundel County, compiled from various sources, and spanning 1932-2010. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shorelines were acquired online from the 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/t-sheets. html), 2) the NOAA National Shoreline data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/index. html), and 3) the NOAA Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/cusp. html). The ca. 1940 Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) shorelines were extracted in the early 1990s from Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of NOAA. MGS digitized these shorelines directly from bromide or mylar copies of the Coastal Survey maps. The ca. 1990 MGS shorelines were digitized by EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, MD in 2000. EDI extracted the shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). This shoreline feature class was created by appending the twenty individual shoreline data sets into one master shoreline feature class file, and retains the original attribute field names from the twenty input files. As such, the original attribute information for each input dataset is part of this final shoreline feature class. MGS also created seven additional attribute fields, some which are required for DSAS analysis and some of which facilitated general data management\/analysis -- DSAS_DATE, DSAS_UNC, DSAS_SRC, DSAS_DEC, DSAS_CO, DSAS_NPROJ, and DSAS_SLINF. Here is a list of the individual data sets (by source) compiled for this master shoreline feature class (all data sets clipped to county boundaries): 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data sets -- CM7202; 2) NOAA National Shoreline data sets -- CS288, MD1932A1, MD1932A2, MD1932A3, MD1932B, MD1933D, MD1933E, MD1933F, MD1934A, CS307, MD1941A1, PH6008, PH6009A, PH6609, CM7415, and CM7601; 3) MGS data sets -- 1940 and 1990 MGS shoreline; and 4) NOAA CUSP data set.

This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

The SSURGO data selected for this application consist of basic descriptions of the data (from the Map Unit Feature Class and Map Unit tables), a collection of interpretations (from the MUAGGATT table), and aggregated information about the components of each map unit (Component table). We chose these data because they represent the most commonly used fields in SSURGO and many of these values serve as standard inputs to assessment and modeling processes. Included in the map package is a zip folder containing 19 layer files to symbolize the data. The layer files contain the symbology from the Soil Mobile and Web Maps Group on ArcGIS. com. To access the folder use the Extract Package tool in the Data Management Toolbox then open the folder containing the extracted map package in Windows Explorer and navigate to commondata userdata and unzip the LayerFiles. zip folder. Data from the four SSURGO tables were assembled into the single table included in each map package. Data from the component table were aggregated using a dominant component model (listed below under Component Table Dominant Component) or a weighted average model (listed below under Component Table Weighted Average) using custom Python scripts. The the Mapunit table, the MUAGATTAT table and the processed Component table data were joined to the Mapunit Feature Class. Field aliases were added and indexes calculated. A field named Map Symbol was created and populated with random integers from 1-10 for symbolizing the soil units in the map package.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data. The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and\/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s). Last Updated: Unknown",

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and\/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. Last Updated: Unknown",

To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area.

To quantify rates of change (erosion or accretion) along coastal and estuarine shorelines in Maryland, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), in conjunction with Towson University s Center for Geographic Information Sciences (CGIS) and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), installed and ran a computer program, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), using as input a series of digital shoreline vectors dating from 1841-1995. Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a baseline landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs, DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect. Last Updated: Unknown",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. The results of SLAMM were analyzed for specific conservation criteria for long-term planning that may help increase coastal resiliency in Maryland. The conservation criteria included areas that may support future wetland migration, wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors, high priority aquatic and terrestrial living resources, vulnerable wetland habitat, suitable hydric soils for wetland establishment and marsh-dependent breeding bird habitat. From these criteria a conservation model was developed to prioritize the most important areas for wetland adaptation. As a result the top priorities were used to create the Wetland Adaptation Areas for the Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) used in Marylands GreenPrint.

Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County in 2007. In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

This feature class is linked by relationship class to data from the 2014 Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality. This link allows for users to query water quality assessment information spatially and facilitates the development of other customized visuals. This feature class is built upon the Chesapeake Bay Program's salinity segmentation scheme and Maryland's coverage for the Coastal Bays. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters.

"dc_title_s": "Shoreline Changes - Prince Georges 10 Years Shoreline Erosion Level: Maryland",
"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Prince George's County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38thStreet bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

These are the statistical counterparts of incorporated places, and are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials and generally updated prior to each decennial census. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs.",

The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

The six files combined contain information on over 575,000 spatially verified water well records. The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

The six files combined contain information on over 575,000 spatially verified water well records. The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

"dc_description_s": "This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",

"dc_description_s": "The data in these six files is derived from Wellogic, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. The six files combined contain information on over 575,000 spatially verified water well records. The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

For example Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below). Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 50 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For exampleField Definitions:Identification Weeknumber Week of Year Records which do not have a time of day associated with the violation were excluded from these summaries.",

"dc_description_s": "Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for Washington This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized at the parcel level. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that Examples of such features are sidewalks Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 138% of that feature is tree canopy. Key parcel attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original parcel layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7 Cadastral data (ownership parcels) were current as of January 26",

"dc_description_s": "Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for Washington This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized by ward. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that Examples of such features are sidewalks Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 138% of that feature is tree canopy. Key ward attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original wards layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7 The wards layer was current as of March 5",

This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the \"square\" field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file.

A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces The Topological Faces Shapefile contains the attributes of each topological primitive face. Each face has a unique topological face identifier (TFID) value. Each face in the shapefile includes the key geographic area codes for almost all geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data for both the 2010 Census and Census 2000. The geometries of each of these geographic areas can then be built by dissolving the face geometries on the appropriate key geographic area codes in the Topological Faces Shapefile.",
