Traffic monitoring data is a strategic resource for SHA and Maryland s Department of Transportation. The data is essential in the planning, design and operation of the statewide road system and the development and implementation of state highway improvement and safety programs. TMS is a product of the ISTEA Act of 1991, which required a traffic data program to effectively and efficiently meet SHA s long-term traffic data monitoring and reporting requirements. The quality control feature of the system allow data edit checks and validation for data from the 84 permanent, continuous automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) and short-term traffic counts. The Maryland Traffic Volume Maps depict the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) at various locations on Maryland s roadways by county. Traffic Volume data is collected from over 8700 program count stations and 84 ATRs, located throughout Maryland. To date, four (4) ATRs have been removed from the ATR Program. Program count data is collected (both directions) at regular locations on either a three (3) year or six (6) year cycle depending on type of roadway. Growth Factors are applied to counts which were not taken during the current year and the counts are factored based on the past yearly growth of an associated ATR. Counters are placed for 48 hours on a Monday or Tuesday and are picked up that Thursday or Friday, respectively. The ATR and toll count data is collected on a continuous basis. Toll station data is provided by the Maryland Transportation Authority. A special numeric code was added to the AADT numbers, starting in 2006, to identify the years when the count was actually taken. The last digit represents the number of years prior to the actual count. Where 0 represents the current year when data was collected (in 2014), 1 represents the count taken in 2013, 2 represents the count taken in 2012, 3 represents the count taken in 2011 and so forth.

The intent of the project was to compile an inventory of waterfront dependent Industries throughout the watershed of the Choptank River, which is located on the eastern shore of Maryland. The second year of the regional project expanded the year 1 pilot inventory focusing next on the lower eastern shore of Maryland including the Atlantic Coastal Bays, south of the Choptank watershed pilot study area to the Virginia border.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. In 2012 The Chesapeake and Coastal Service (CSS), a division of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources developed a pilot project to identify working waterfronts for both water dependent business and commercial watermen. The intent of the project was to compile an inventory of waterfront dependent Industries throughout the watershed of the Choptank River, which is located on the eastern shore of Maryland. The second year of the regional project expanded the year 1 pilot inventory focusing next on the lower eastern shore of Maryland including the Atlantic Coastal Bays, south of the Choptank watershed pilot study area to the Virginia border. On the western shore the inventory includes the Potomac River from Washington harbor to Point Lookout and then along the shore to the South River. Last Updated: 02\/2015",

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U. S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U. S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U. S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

It depicts the State with 138 separate watersheds each with an 8-digit numeric code. The file was created primarily for State and Federal agency use. The creation of this file goes back many years and involved several State and Federal agencies. This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed). The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7. 5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions. This file is similar, but not identical, to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p. 1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7. 5 minute quadrangle map sheets. Some watershed drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area Watersheds were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres.

Hydrologic unit boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point. Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for Hydrologic unit boundaries define the aerial extent of surface water drainage to a point. Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions, 222 Subregions, 352 Accounting Units, and 2,149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448,000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service, initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U. S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7. 5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland, using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24,000. A new 12-digit watershed file is available from DNR which provides more detailed line work for over 1,100 watersheds which is approximately equivalent to the HUC 14-digit code. Last Updated: 1998",

The intent of this dataset is for it to be used to produce maps and provide a spatial reference for all Tier II segments located in Maryland. The Clean Water Act requires that States review their water quality standards every three years and revise the standards as necessary. During this required Triennial Review the State reviewed the antidegradation policy, and identified additional stream segments that meet the minimum requirements. Current Tier II designations are made based on biological characteristics from Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data, which is collected annually. MBSS data which identifies new Tier II segments in between Triennial Review cycles are maintained on the pending list, as they are awaiting formal promulgation. The publicly maintained list of all Tier II waters can be found for each county at the following website: http:\/\/mde. maryland. gov\/programs\/Water\/TMDL\/Integrated303dReports\/Pages\/Antidegradation. aspx.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The digital segmented network based on watershed boundaries, ERF1-2, includes enhancements to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's River Reach File 1 (RF1) (USEPA, 1996; DeWald and others, 1985) to support national and regional-scale surface water-quality modeling. Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1, which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System, SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U. S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients, including total nitrogen and total phosphorus, (Smith, R. A. , Schwarz, G. E. , and Alexander, R. B. , 1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1. 2; Alexander et al. 1999), and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al. , 1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin, 1996; Verdin and Jenson, 1996). A 1-kilometer raster grid of ERF1-2 projected to Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, NAD 27 Datum (Snyder, 1987), was merged with the HYDRO1K flow direction data set (Verdin and Jenson, 1996) to generate a DEM-based watershed grid, ERF1_2WS. The watershed boundaries are maintained in a raster (grid cell) format as well as a vector (polygon) format for subsequent model analysis. Both the coverage, ERF1-2, and the grid, ERF1-2WS are available at: http:\/\/water. usgs. gov\/lookup\/gisgetlist. The version of RF1 used to compile ERF1-2 was an early edition of a USGS RF1 translation and was updated by USEPA (USEPA, 1996). The capabilities of the enhanced version of RF1 (ERF1-2) and the current USEPA version have not been evaluated. The user is referred to the USEPA version [http:\/\/www. epa. gov\/owow\/monitoring\/rf\/rfindex] for discussions of streamflow accuracy and general background on the origin of RF1.

Begun as a pilot in 2000, Maryland Stream Waders is a statewide volunteer stream monitoring program managed by Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Monitoring and Nontidal Assessment Division. Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others. Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each), while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus, Stream Waders data should help fill the gaps left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS. Stream Waders sample, for the most part, in the sameoverall watersheds each year where MBSS crews sample. Last Updated: 09\/2012",

Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.

It was created primarily for state and federal agency use. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p. 1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7. 5 minute quadrangle map sheets. Some watersheds drainage areas were defined for streams less than third order and some large area watershed were split to maintain a maximum size of 15,000 acres. The watershed boundaries in this file were developed in a joint state and federal effort to create a consistent watershed file for use by all government agencies with an interest in Maryland's watersheds. The U. S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) redefined the third order watersheds creating the HUA14 file.

Including Baltimore City makes a total of 17 designated locations based on sixteen County Boundaries and one City Boundary. Four main models were created to perform the overlay processes to calculate the Zonal Majority used to determine the total rank for all the segments. The Blue Infrastructure assessment was designed as a spatial evaluation of coastal habitat, critical natural resources and associated human uses in the tidal waters and near-shore areas of Maryland's coastal zone. The Assessment is used to identify near-shore tidal habitat priority areas that support coastal habitats and the resources and economies that depend upon them.

USACE, Maryland Geological Survey (MGS), Minerals Management Service (MMS), and academic scientists have studied the seafloor and shoals of the Maryland offshore study area in order to determine their potential use as a source of sand for beach nourishment. Studies conducted by MGS of Fenwick, Weaver, and Isle of Wight Shoals show four general patterns of substrate conditions:1) Shoal crest - generally is restricted to the undisturbed shoal crest at depths less than 35 it (11. 2 m) and, has no discernable bedforms; Shoal crests consist of sand with almost no shell material; Coarser gravels are concentrated in areas of greatest wave and current energies, such as along the shoal crest. 2) Flank- bottom class associated With the shoal crest; primarily found along the shoal flanks between -35 ft and -40 ft, representing transitional bottom, from shoal crest to intershoal bottom type; sand, the texture of which may or may not be significantly different than that of the shoal crest; occasional ripples; sand with some shell and other biogenic materials. 3). Intershoal-associated with the deeper sea bottom ( 40 feet), both disturbed (dredged) and undisturbed intershoal areas or troughs; sandy bottom dominated by small ripples ( 0. 40 meter widths); sand with richer but not abundant benthos. 4) Patch occurring in the deeper sea bottom ( 40 feet) in trough or intershoal areas; large patches, ~l00 it in diameter, associated with rippled bottom within the dredged area; interpreted to be soft, finer-grained sediment based on low backscatter intensity return; Patch-mat regions occur between shoals that have muddy substrates, abundant patches\/mats of worm tube colonies, and shell beds.

Volumetric estimations for Fenwick, Weaver, Isle of Wight shoals used vibracore data collected in 1992 1997, volumes were calculated in 2000 (Conkwright, Williams and Christiansen, 2000). Borrow Area 2 has been virtually exhausted by dredging. Between 1988-1992, ~2. 9 million m^3 was dredged from Borrow Area 2, ~4. 2 million m^3 dredged from Borrow Area 3, and ~3. 2 million m^3 dredged from Borrow Area 9 (Wells, 1994). Revised volumentric estimations for Shoals B, C, D, Little Gull Bank Great Gull Bank (1996) In the 1993 sand resources study (Conkwright and Gast, 1994b) the seismically defined ravinement surface was used as the lower structural boundary for volume calculations. However, the purpose of the current study is to estimate only the volume of sand with measured physical parameters. Therefore, the lower boundary for volumetric calculations was determined primarily by the grain size parameters of vibracore samples. The lower boundary surface was set at the depth where the sampled sand became too fine or too poorly sorted for use as beach fill. In those cases where the entire length of core contained usable sand, the boundary surface was set at the depth of maximum vibracore penetration. Because vibracore penetrations on Little and Great Gull Banks were generally within a meter of the ravinement surface, that surface was used as the lower boundary for those shoals, unless vibracore samples indicated otherwise.

The Rural Legacy Areas file is a digital, polygon layer showing Marylands designated Rural Legacy areas.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) are two tools used to protect lands from development. Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) is a voluntary, incentive-based program that allows landowners to sell development rights from their land to a developer or other interested party who then can use these rights to increase the density of development at another designated location. While the seller of development rights still owns the land and can continue using it, an easement is placed on the property that prevents further development. A TDR program protects land resources at the same time providing additional income to both the landowner and the holder of the development rights. Source: https:\/\/www. uwsp. edu\/cnr-ap\/clue\/Documents\/PlanImplementation\/Transfer_of_Development_Rights. pdf The Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) is a voluntary program in which a land trust or a local, county or state agency buys the development rights on a parcel of land, primarily agricultural. PDRs permanently extinguish all preexisting development potential of a particular property and are not used to offset development elsewhere in the county. Other than very limited rights reserved to the original grantor and their immediate family, no further commercial or residential subdivision is allowed. The grantor of the easement and all subsequent owners of the property retain full fee simple ownership of the land, but are bound by the terms of the Deed of Easement in perpetuity.

The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages over 446,000 acres of public lands and protected open space in the state. The DNR Lands data (part of Technology Toolbox Protected Lands data set) consists of mapped information that represent those lands that are owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers, establish wetlands, protect highly erodible land, and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) are lands and watersheds of high ecological value that have been identified as conservation priorities by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for natural resource protection. These areas represent the most ecologically valuable areas in the State: they are the best of the best. TEAs are preferred for conservation funding through Stateside Program Open Space. This version updates the 2008 TEA layer. The first step in updating TEAs was to create an ecological baseline composed of several ecological databases which included updates of original databases and additional databases developed since 2008. The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large, contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure s hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration, reduces forest fragmentation if protected, and provides important ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, cleaning air and water, storing nutrients, and protecting areas against storm and flood damage. The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species, rare plant and animal communities, species of Greatest Conservation Need, and wildlife concentrations. The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity, Tier II regulated streams, and brook trout streams. The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests, wetlands, and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality. The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities. These are areas important for sustaining coastal and tidal ecosystems and also identifies land areas important for sustaining spawning and nursery areas for important commercial and recreational fisheries. The climate change adaptation component identifies areas important for sustaining wetlands ecosystems that are changing and moving landward in response to sea level rise. From the ecological baseline, areas that ranked as most important for each of the components were merged to create the Targeted Ecological Areas. Lands that were developed, as identified by the Maryland Department of Planning (2010) were removed from the TEA layer since developed lands are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding. Additionally, lands that are in the 0 foot to 2 foot inundation zone based on the 2011 SLAMM (Maryland Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model) study performed for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City since these areas are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The Marsh Protection Potential Index (MPPI) ranks Maryland s coastal marshes by their ability to protect vulnerable communities from coastal hazards. To do so, we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat Is the marsh located where there are people to protect Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources, we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then, the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating, which ranks the protective ability of over 14,000 marshes statewide. It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes, rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh, nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition, the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity, ecosystem health, rare species, recreation value, or water quality services are often important to stakeholders, and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement, not replace, the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats. Last Updated: 3\/31\/2016",

Inputs to the model included 6 physical variables (geomorphology, elevation, sea level rise, wave power, storm surge height and erosion rates) and 5 habitat types (forest, marsh, dune, oyster reef and underwater grass). Two scenarios of the model were run: one scenario incorporating the protective role of all existing coastal habitats and the other scenario simulating the complete loss of habitats. The difference between the two scenarios indicates the potential magnitude of coastal hazard reduction by habitats at each location. Model results were integrated with MD DNR s Community Flood Risk Areas (March, 2016) in order to highlight areas where hazard reduction by habitats is most likely to benefit at-risk coastal communities.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The TIGER\/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and\/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population\/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). Last Updated: 01\/1\/2010",

There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.

When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.

The designation will continue for a period of 24 months, during which time local governments will have the opportunity to apply for continued Sustainable Communities designation. Community Legacy Areas designated prior to January 1, 2008 will become Sustainable Community for 24 months after June 1, 2010. Existing Community Legacy Areas designated on or after January 1, 2008 will be considered Sustainable Communities for a period of 36 months after June 1, 2010. An application procedure is being developed for local governments to request continued Sustainable Communities designation beyond the transition period. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will begin accepting applications for Sustainable Communities in the Fall of 2010. Applications for Sustainable Communities designation will be reviewed by an interagency panel led by DHCD and must be approved by the Governor s Smart Growth Subcabinet. Once approved, newly designated Sustainable Communities (those that apply after June 1, 2010) will retain their designation for a period of five years. Sustainable Communities also include designated Transit Oriented Development Zones (TOD s) and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Zones. These areas are automatically considered Sustainable Communities effective June 1, 2010 and do not need to reapply for continued designation.

Find more information at'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Polygon features that represent the political boundaries of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) that exist in Maryland and for which the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is a member. In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland's borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size \/ extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive ('3'C') planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member'jurisdictions'has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:'National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)https:\/\/www.mwcog.org\/tpb\/- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland-'City'of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)https:\/\/baltometro.org\/- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)http:\/\/alleganygov.org\/473\/Metropolitan-Planning-Organization- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown \/ Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)https:\/\/www.hepmpo.net\/- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)http:\/\/www.wilmapco.org\/- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury \/ Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S \/ WMPO)http:\/\/www.swmpo.org\/- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland-'City'of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)http:\/\/www.calvert-stmarysmpo.com\/- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT).

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) designates Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) for purposes of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. The LIHTC program is defined in Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The LIHTC is a tax incentive intended to increase the availability of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC statute provides two criteria for QCT eligibility. A census tract must have either: 1) a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 2) 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income. The area corresponds to a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census. Last Updated: 01\/2017",

In 2000, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal ZoneManagement grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland - the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, Md. , to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available, EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, NAD 83, meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors. Following shoreline extraction or interpretation, EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type: beach, vegetated, structure, or water's edge. This data set has been merged into a state wide file for ease of processing and decision making. Last Updated: 2003",

The areas in this data set were determined from USGS Terrapin studies (for more information contact Paula Henry, 410-465-0550 or paula. henry@usgs. gov), DNR studies conducted by Margaret Whilden, and a terrapin study conducted by Willem Roosenburg (contact information can be acquired from Harley Speir of DNR Fisheries Service). For extent acquracies please contact the project lead for each study. Secondary habitats were delineated using sandy beach data from VIMS and salinity data from Lee Karrh of DNR. Sandy beach areas were selected and exported from the source file and then combined with the salinity data to determine sensitivity importance levels. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county. Last Updated: 04\/10\/2012",

In 1987, the Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed by states within the Chesapeake Bay region including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia. This agreement included commitments for providing fish passage within each state: to provide for fish passage at dams, and remove stream blockages wherever necessary to restore passage for migratory fish. With this humble beginning, the Chesapeake Bay states set a goal to reopen a total of 1,357 miles of historical spawning grounds by the year 2003. Maryland's portion of this goal is to reopen 388. 65 miles of stream. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program has taken this commitment very seriously; to date the Program has completed 61 projects, reopening a total 348. 9 miles of upstream spawning habitat. Several projects scheduled to be completed by 2003 will allow the Program to not only meet but also exceed the goal set forth by the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Meeting this goal has been a cooperative effort between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, State Highway Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service - National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, Department of Interior - US Fish Wildlife, Environmental Protection Agency, Chesapeake Bay Program, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, University Maryland and a multitude of others including private citizens, local watershed groups and local governments.

The dataset displays the presence and absence of forested areas within a 100 foot-buffer of a stream or waterbody. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) stream layer developed by the United States Geological Survey was buffered 100-feet on each side of the stream centerline to determine stream buffers in Maryland. A shoreline file developed by the Maryland State Highway Administration was buffered 100-feet to determine the shoreline buffer in Maryland. The resulting buffer layers were clipped with a forest cover layer to determine the presence and absence of forest in those buffers. The forest cover layer was derived from a tree canopy layer developed by the Community College of Baltimore County, Catonsville, Geography Department. The tree canopy was developed using 2007 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) color infra-red 1-meter imagery. To determine areas forested, contiguous areas of tree cover less than 1 acre were removed from the dataset and then used for clipping the stream and shoreline buffers. Last Updated: 2010",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. The Clean Water Act requires three components to water quality standards that set goals for and protect each States' waters. The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e. g. , recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e. g. , bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26. 08. 02. 04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4. 00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. In 2007, State leaders in Maryland took a bold step in their efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay with the creation of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund (Trust Fund). The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded, the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually. This file depicts the Bay Trust Fund current priority zones. Priority zone areas were developed using information from the USGS SPARROW model and local knowledge and expertise. Coastal Bays watersheds were prioritized based on the expertise of scientists in that region. - SPARROW is a regression-based model for regional interpretation of water quality monitoring data. SPARROW discriminates which watersheds are likely to contribute the highest nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay. - The Biological Restoration Initiative (BRI) targeting identifies biologically impaired waters that demonstrate a high potential for removal from Marylands 303(d) list of impaired waters. Their selection is based on evaluation using the Biological Listing Methodology results listed in Marylands 2008 Integrated Report, which sets a threshold for degradation within Marylands non-tidal freshwater streams using the index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores from sampled fish and benthic communities. These watersheds have been targeted primarily for 319(h) grant program, which has a goal of delisting impaired surface waters. - The Atlantic Coastal Bay watersheds were selected based on the pattern of trajectories of the water quality index (dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus) between 2001-2006 (http:\/\/ian. umces. edu\/press\/books\/publication\/93\/shifting_sands_envi ronmental_and_cultural_change_in_maryland_s_coastal_bays_2009- 06-08\/). Agricultural and urbanized watersheds were evaluated separately to identify the highest nutrient loading areas. For urban watersheds developed lands were analyzed, while agricultural watersheds were separated into cropland and animal production systems. Last Updated: 2014",

Some of these opportunities have been capitalized upon?a number of significant trail segments already exist or are currently moving toward construction?but gaps still exist. In May 2012, DVRPC Board Member Terence Farrell and DVRPC Executive Director Barry Seymour joined Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter to celebrate the efforts of foundations, governments, non-profits, economic development professionals, and numerous other groups to fill these gaps and create an interconnected network of multi-use trails called The Circuit. ?This dataset reflects trail status and is a conceptual dataset - to be used at the regional-level only.?Connect the Circuit",

"dc_description_s": "The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) contracted Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) to perform a 2015 Land Use Update (aka Phase 1, Product 1, P1) and to create a 2015 Enhanced Land Use Update (aka Phase 2, Product 2, P2) data set for the nine-county DVRPC region consisting of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania, and Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey. The project started in February 2016 and completed in April 2017. AIS used computer interactive photo interpretation and heads-up digitizing to create both land use datasets. The project was performed in two phases.This metadata is for the Enhanced Land Use (P2) mapping effort.The P2 layer was the creation of an enhanced land use layer using a more detailed land use classification and standardized data capture criteria, including minimum mapping size guidelines for built-up land use types and parking lots. The P2 layer will support DVRPC?s more detailed planning analyses goals and other programs and projects at DVRPC and their member governments and agencies.Despite some overlap in the land use classification and data capture criteria for each effort, the P1 and P2 geodatabases do not completely correlate to one another due to the more detailed P2 classification, changes in the categorization of some land use features from P1 to P2 and revisions to the original DVRPC data capture criteria.All work was performed by AIS staff, at the AIS office in Redlands, California using Esri ArcGIS 10.3 software capabilities. No sub-contractors or outside consultants were used throughout the performance of the contract.Detailed Metadata Document",

Delaware Valley Data is our periodic series of free data bulletins, data snapshots, and analytical data reports. This analytical data report provides revised 2040 and interim-year population and employment forecasts for the DVRPC region?s counties and municipalities. DVRPC prepared these forecasts in order to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census, account for the ongoing economic recession, and maintain a 30-year planning horizon. 2040 population forecasts were originally adopted by the DVRPC Board on January 26, 2012 and published in April 2012 in Analytical Data Report 18. On February 28, 2013, the DVRPC Board amended the 2040 and interim year population forecasts for Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to account for a significant residential development that was unforeseen when the 2040 population forecasts were adopted in January 2012. This amendment resulted in corresponding revisions to the population forecasts for Montgomery County and the DVRPC region as a whole. This amended analytical data report includes these revisions. This report also consolidates the adopted population forecasts for Princeton Township and Princeton Borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, which merged and became one municipality known simply as Princeton on January 1, 2013. Additionally, inconsistencies in some summary totals in ADR 18 caused by rounding were also corrected. The adopted population forecasts provided in this report will serve as the basis for DVRPC?s planning and modeling activities, along with the 2040 employment forecasts that were prepared and adopted in September 2012.NETS database for 2010 was used for employment data.http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/asp\/pubs\/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR019http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/asp\/pubs\/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR018-ASource of geographic boundaries: DVRPC",

The TIGER\/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File \/ Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF\/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and\/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and\/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business\/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. This dataset provides the Tier II catchments delineated for the most downstream Tier II segment. This file also provides the assimilative capacity (AC) status for each watershed. In cases where there is no remaining AC in a nested catchment but the larger encompassing segment has remaining AC, the smaller nested catchment is split out and assigned its own identification. These nested catchments are also then attributed to show the lack of AC remaining. The intended use of the catchment dataset is to assist State, Local, and Federal officials and stakeholders in determining the antidegradation status of current or planned activities which fall under the purview of the antidegradation policy and implementation procedure (COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-1). Using GIS, the stakeholder can assess if any activity, proposed or operational, such as a discharge, is located on land which drains (has run off) directly into and can potentially adversely affect a Tier II stream segment. This type of determination would be useful for permitting purposes, screening for sensitive or high quality resources, and various land use planning activities such as those undertaken by local officials during the Water Resources Element process, Water and Sewer Planning, or the Comprehensive Planning process.
