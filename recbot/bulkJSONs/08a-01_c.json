The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 2.5 pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, 8-bit intensity images, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. To better understand one of the state 2019s most vital natural resources and accurately plan for the future, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), through grant funding provided to the Pennsylvania Sea Grant (PASG) College Program, partnered with Woolpert to acquire imagery and lidar data for the entire Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed and all 77 miles of shoreline. - See more at: http:\/\/www.xyht.com\/aerialuas\/heights-april-2017-mapping-the-pennsylvania-lake-erie-watershed\/#sthash.n3pVphR6.dpuf",

The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 2.5 pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, 8-bit intensity images, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. To better understand one of the state 2019s most vital natural resources and accurately plan for the future, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), through grant funding provided to the Pennsylvania Sea Grant (PASG) College Program, partnered with Woolpert to acquire imagery and lidar data for the entire Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed and all 77 miles of shoreline. - See more at: http:\/\/www.xyht.com\/aerialuas\/heights-april-2017-mapping-the-pennsylvania-lake-erie-watershed\/#sthash.n3pVphR6.dpuf",

Dataset Description: Allentown, Pennsylvania 2016 QL1 LiDAR project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and production of products derivative of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection\/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South Zone, US survey feet and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID 12B), US survey feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 129 individual 2,500-foot X 2,500-foot tiles, 1-foot hydro-flattened bare-earth raster DEMs in ERDAS .IMG format and intensity images in GeoTIFF format, tiled to the same 2,500-foot X 2,500-foot tile schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. A mosaic of the hydro-flattened bare-earth raster DEMs was produced in ERDAS .IMG format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, A total of 18 calibration control points in order to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. The accuracy of the data was checked with 20 NVA points and 5 VVA points (25 total QC checkpoints).",
