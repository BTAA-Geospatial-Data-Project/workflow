"dc_description_s": "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Executive Order on Environmental Justice (#12898) do not provide specific guidance to evaluate EJ issues within a region's transportation planning process. Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. DVRPC currently assesses demographic population groups from Census tables and uses it to gather data from the 2012 - 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. Using U.S. Census American Community Survey data, the population groups are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.

Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. The results will inform priorities for the City s digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City s efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013.",

"dc_description_s": "This dataset indicates areas designated as eligible for resources provided through the Great Streets Neighborhood Business District Program. Eligible areas were designated in The Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable Growth and consist of Activity Centers, Commercial Nodes, Commercial Corridors, and LRT Station Areas. Exact parcel boundaries of Activity Centers and Commercial Nodes are identified in The Minneapolis Plan. Commercial Corridor areas are generally defined as a one block radius from designated corridors. LRT Station Areas are defined as a mile radius from each LRT station outside of downtown. Some staff discretion was used in determining precise boundaries for Commercial Corridors and LRT Station Areas in cases where roadways or other natural boundaries made exact definitions unclear. Each area is categorized based on a number of metrics used to determine its economic health and opportunity. Varying levels of Great Streets program resources are available, based on this categorization.",

"dc_description_s": "Properties are organized by the category in which they were phased in to the benchmarking program, with important metrics from the most recent reporting year of 2015 being toggleable. By clicking on a point, a user may learn more about an individual property's characteristics, energy efficiency, and water use from prior reporting years when available. Public buildings from the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Minneapolis Public Schools were phased in first and therefore show data for 2012-2015. The largest private buildings 100,000 sqft and greater, show publicly available data starting in 2014. The remaining category, private buildings between 50,000-100,000 sqft in size, data is made publicly available starting with the 2015 dataset. The toggleable metrics highlight the most summary information of building energy and water efficiency: ENERGY STAR score - The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country. The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours. A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer. The higher the score, the more efficient the building. Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - The metric used for comparing buildings in Energy Star, EUI expresses a building s energy use relative to its size. In this report it is expressed as kBtu\/ft , and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (in kBtu) and dividing it by the floor area of the building (in ft ). The lower the kBtu\/ft , the lower the energy consumption. Weather-normalized Energy Use Intensity - Energy use is adjusted to account year-to-year weather differences, allowing for comparison of a building to itself over time. Through this procedure, the energy in a given year is adjusted to express the energy that would have been consumed under 30-year average weather conditions. Weather-normalized EUI also uses the kBtu\/ft unit. The maps provided by the City of Minneapolis are compilations of records, information and data from various sources, and they are to be used for reference purposes only. The City of Minneapolis does not warrant or guarantee that the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data or maps are complete, current, or accurate. The City of Minneapolis does not represent that the GIS data can be used for navigational, tracking, legal, engineering, surveying, or any other purpose requiring exacting measurement of distance or direction or precision in the depiction of geographic features.

"dc_description_s": "This polygon feature class represents the spatial extent of surficial geology deposits, glacial and sub-glacial drainage, and historical glacial lake shoreline areas in Oakland County. These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. The key attribute is the geologic sediment type.The primary business purpose for the development of this data set was to collaborate with the Cranbrook Institute of Science in producing an educational map about the surficial geology of Oakland County at a scale appropriate to Countywide and sub-County applications. Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. Zawiskie QC'd the data through visual inspections of plots, and Nina Misuraca instituted the corrections.",

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of potential natural areas. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the 2004 Oakland County Natural Areas Report update. Each feature was assigned a priority of One, Two, or Three. Digital Landcover, orthophotography, and USGS quadrangle maps were the main sources used to identify each natural area. The data from the Oakland County Natural Areas update project was collected in 2004. Key attributes include Priority and TotalScore. Priority is a reflection of quality and indicates the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state of the identified area.The NaturalArea2004 data should be distributed with the Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004. This document provides essential information for the attributes and procedures used to create the features in the dataset. Shiawassee  Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project - March 2000 Project Staff: Carlisle Wortman  Associates - Richard Carlisle, PCP, and Carey Nyberg Land Information Access Association - Joe VanderMeulen Michigan Natural Features Inventory - John Paskus Oakland County Planning  Economic Development Services - Bret C. Rasegan, RA, Charlotte P. Burckhardt, AICP, PCP, Lawrence S. Falardeau, RLA, Russell Lewis, RA, Leslie E. Kettren, AICP, Jim Keglovitz, and JoAnn Browning The Shiawassee and Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project involved six communities (Highland, Milford, Rose, Springfield, and White Lake Townships, and the Village of Milford) in western Oakland County. A Steering Committee composed of local officials, developers, property owners, and land conservancy members was the policy group that directed the project. The Steering Committee contracted with the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) to identify potentially significant natural areas. Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - July 2002 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Michael Penskar, Program Leader - Botany Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Michigan Natural Features Inventory P.O. Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 This report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in Oakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the landscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of potential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural features. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological services such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil development and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel corridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic diversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological value of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas can also be used to update and track the status of these remaining sites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local municipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize conservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. In this report the term potential natural area has been used in place of the term potential conservation area. The substitution was made in order to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites that are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better understanding of the term natural area. The term potential natural area, however, is not to be confused with the legal term dedicated Natural Area as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which gives land special legal protection.When using this information it is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a starting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, each community, group or individual using this information should determine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. Materials and Interpretation Methodology: Interpretation of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using digital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's Planning and Economic Development Services Division. As the townships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this imagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for Geographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b), and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These additional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the interpretation process. Delineation of sites was done through aerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) wetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested tracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done conservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up being eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of omitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated by focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much development (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as possible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads, parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural areas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal boundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the boundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all sites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. Following the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential natural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each site could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total calculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.",

Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

Check out the Statewide Park and Ride System application, found on the Iowa DOT Interactive Map Portal.The Iowa Department of Transportation s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",

It is the purpose of this section to enhance opportunities for the development and diversification of the state s economy through the identification and improvement of a network of commercial and industrial highways. The network shall consist of interconnected routes which provide long distance route continuity. The purpose of this highway network shall be to improve the flow of commerce; to make travel more convenient, safe, and efficient; and to better connect Iowa with regional, national, and international markets. The commission shall concentrate a major portion of its annual construction budget on this network of commercial and industrial highways. In order to ensure the greatest possible availability of funds for the improvement of the network, primary highway funds shall not be spent beyond continuing maintenance for improvements to route segments that will be bypassed by the relocation of portions of the commercial and industrial highway network. 2. Network selection.a. The commission shall identify, within the primary road system, a network of commercial and industrial highways. The commission shall consider all of the following factors in the identification of this network: i. The connection by the most direct routes feasible of major urban areas and regions of the state to each other and to the national system of interstate and defense highways and priority routes in adjacent states. ii. The existence of high volumes of total traffic and commercial traffic. iii. Long distance traffic movements. iv. Area coverage and balance of spacing with service to major growth centers within the state. v. Metropolitan area bypasses consistent with metropolitan or regional area plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials.b. The network of commercial and industrial highways shall not exceed two thousand six hundred miles including municipal extensions of these highways. 3. Standards. The department shall establish standards pertaining to the specific location, design, and access control for each segment of the commercial and industrial highways. 4. Network development. In establishing priorities for improvement projects, the department shall take into consideration the following additional criteria: urban area bypasses that improve urban or regional accessibility or improve corridor travel; projects consistent with regional or metropolitan transportation plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials; and the willingness of local officials to provide financial or other assistance for the development of projects.Source: Iowa Code Section 313.2A Primary Roads: Commercial and Industrial Highways. http:\/\/search.legis.state.ia.us\/nxt\/gateway.dll\/ic\/1\/13\/10856\/10857\/11188\/11191 f=templatesfn=default.htm.",

The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified bathtub model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the local minima were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and\/or Chesapeake Bay influence. -1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve. See http:\/\/www. corpsclimate. us\/ccaceslcurves. cfmfor more detail. -2 Closest station with historic records of 40 years or greater.

The purpose of creating this file was to use MesoMap to create high-resolution wind maps of the state and to provide wind resource data in a format enabling the assessment of potential wind development sites in a GIS. By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower, LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data. Although it is believed to represent an accurate overall picture of the wind energy resource, estimates at any location should be confirmed by measurement. Last Updated: Unknown",

This data layer contains waterbird density blocks extracted from the Minerals Management Service's Mid-Atlantic Waterbird Data Beta Version 1. 0. This application is based on their Marine Mammal and Seabird Computer Database Analysis System (MMS-CDAS). The origin of the underlying data is a U. S. Fish Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December, 2001 and March, 2003. The source data were collected on-transect (120m width, 60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, in Delaware Bay, and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22. 2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia \/ North Carolina border. All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects. The spatial extent of the database (and thus of this data set) is from the Virginia\/North Carolina border to the Hudson Canyon (including Delaware Bay and the lowest part of Chesapeake Bay).
