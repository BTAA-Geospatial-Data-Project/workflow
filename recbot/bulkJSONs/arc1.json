"dc_description_s": "The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on the NHD, go to http:\/\/nhd.usgs.gov\/index.html. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http:\/\/nhd.usgs.gov\/wbd.html.",

To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",

This program was established in 1967 to measure seasonal and annual water quality changes in the state's major aquifers. The network initially consisted of 12 large production wells, and was expanded to 60 wells in 1972. In 1986, the network was further expanded to around 90 wells. A large number of public water supply wells were added to the network in the late 1980s and early 1990s to provide better representation of the major aquifers in Ohio.The program currently includes over 200 wells (stations). Of the total stations, roughly 85 percent are public water systems and 15 percent are industrial or commercial enterprises or residential. Raw water is analyzed for a suite of inorganic parameters every six, 18, or 36 months depending on the total number of samples that have been collected and the stability of the geochemistry of major elements at the site. Samples are also analyzed for volatile organic compounds once every 18 or 36 months. Some ambient sites have historical semi-volatile organic compounds and pesticide data.",

"dc_description_s": "The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination. To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",

Many of these properties are located in highly urbanized areas which rely on community water systems to supply residents with safe drinking water. In those areas, ground water that contains chemicals from prior industrial or commercial activities poses no perceptible risk to the community because the ground water is not being used and will not be used for drinking water purposes in the foreseeable future. In these situations, an\u00a0Urban Setting Designation (USD)\u00a0may be appropriate.\u00a0A USD recognizes that cleaning up the ground water to drinking water standards is not necessary because no one will be drinking the ground water. Other possible exposures to contaminated ground water (such as exposures to wildlife or streams in the area, or volatilization of contaminants to indoor air) still must be addressed even when a USD is granted for an area. USDs can be granted only by the director of Ohio EPA. The request must successfully demonstrate the property (or properties) meets all the criteria of a USD as specified in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 3745-300-10 before such a designation can be granted.\u00a0The use of a urban setting\u00a0\u00a0designation (USD) to establish ground water response requirements for\u00a0\u00a0a property undergoing a voluntary action is contingent upon the following: Verification that the boundaries of the property undergoing the voluntary action lie completely within the USD area; and verification that no significant change of circumstances has occurred that would affect the criteria upon which the USD is approved at the time of the issuance of a no further action letter for the property, in accordance with OAC 3745-300-10(C)(3) and this letter.

"dc_description_s": "The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey, with partial funding from the USEPA through the Ohio EPA, has mapped the lowest Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDWs) across most of the state. The goal of this project is to provide Ohio's oil and gas industry and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources-Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management (DOGRM) with necessary, up-to-date information and maps to properly determine adequate depth of surface casing to protect USDWs. The last mapping effort of the lowest USDW was performed in 1982. In excess of 37,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled since that date without significant updates to the mapping. Further, the 1982 mapping was hand-drawn on paper maps, which are not easily reproducible or updated. Existing water-quality data have been collected and correlated to bedrock geology. The resultant data are being used to produce structure contour maps on the base of the lowest mappable, consolidated (i.e., bedrock) unit designated as a USDW. Surface casing is always required through unconsolidated surficial deposits, whose depths are known from other mapping projects. All information has been compiled and mapped digitally for ease of distribution and future updating. Industry will be able to use these maps and data to correctly estimate the length and cost of casing required for each well prior to submitting a permit application. The DOGRM will be able to directly import the data and maps to their computer applications and use it to establish required casing depths on permit applications.",

"dc_description_s": "The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey, with partial funding from the USEPA through the Ohio EPA, has mapped the lowest Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDWs) across most of the state. The goal of this project is to provide Ohio's oil and gas industry and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources-Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management (DOGRM) with necessary, up-to-date information and maps to properly determine adequate depth of surface casing to protect USDWs. The last mapping effort of the lowest USDW was performed in 1982. In excess of 37,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled since that date without significant updates to the mapping. Further, the 1982 mapping was hand-drawn on paper maps, which are not easily reproducible or updated. Existing water-quality data have been collected and correlated to bedrock geology. The resultant data are being used to produce structure contour maps on the base of the lowest mappable, consolidated (i.e., bedrock) unit designated as a USDW. Surface casing is always required through unconsolidated surficial deposits, whose depths are known from other mapping projects. All information has been compiled and mapped digitally for ease of distribution and future updating. Industry will be able to use these maps and data to correctly estimate the length and cost of casing required for each well prior to submitting a permit application. The DOGRM will be able to directly import the data and maps to their computer applications and use it to establish required casing depths on permit applications.",

"dc_description_s": "Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program - Also known as Wellhead Protection and Drinking Water Source Protection, the Source Water Assessment and Protection (SWAP) program helps public water suppliers protect sources of drinking water (streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and aquifers) from contamination. The SWAP program addresses more than 4,500 public water systems in Ohio. It does not address private residential water systems. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA) - the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake. For more information on the SWAP Program, visit\u00a0http:\/\/epa.ohio.gov\/ddagw\/swap.aspx, send an email to\u00a0mailto:whp@epa.ohio.gov or call (614) 644-2752 and ask to speak with one of the Drinking Water Source Protection staff.\u00a0Data updated daily at midnight.\u00a0",

The sites are primarily solid waste disposal sites, including municipal solid waste, industrial solid waste, residual solid waste, and construction and demolition debris. Some sites with hazardous waste are also included. The types of sites may include licensed landfills, landfills that existed prior to state regulatory programs, exempt waste sites, unauthorized dumps, open dumps, and disposal lagoons. Some sites in the database may have been partially or fully remediated and may no longer contain significant amounts of waste.\u00a0The data are incomplete and are still in development.  New locations will be added and existing locations may be corrected.  This file does not include all sites regulated by Ohio EPA under other regulatory programs (e.g. there are many sites regulated under programs such as hazardous waste sites, surface water, \"brownfields\", etc. that are not included in this dataset).\u00a0Data were developed from Ohio EPA archival files. The accuracy of the locations depends on the available information. Where possible, points were located on the actual waste unit, or within the tax parcel boundary where the waste was said to be located. Some points were located using coordinates or descriptive text in field notes, inspection reports, etc.  In some cases, the best available information is the nearest intersection or an address. When possible the data were compared against local tax maps to improve the accuracy of the locations. Additional sources of information included but were not limited to newspaper archives, solid waste district plans, pollution inventories, historical societies, and local governments.\u00a0The information used in this dataset come from files that date back to the late 1960s and may not represent the current site conditions. The data includes only that known to Ohio EPA's solid waste regulatory program and may not include sites that were under past authority of other regulatory agencies such as local health departments.\u00a0",

The shapefiles were obtained from the Ohio Secretary of State's Office website. Detailed information regarding the development of these shapefiles can be found at: http:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/SOS\/reshape\/GADistricts\/adoptedMap.aspx. THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXERPT FROM THE\u00a0 FINAL OHIO APPORTIONMENT PLAN\u00a0 AS AMENDED, ADOPTED AND ENGROSSED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 - http:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/sos\/upload\/reshape\/GA\/Apportionment-Engrossed.pdf Part A. General Overview\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 To assist users in their review of the legislative district plan, the plan geography is being provided in different formats. These include a geographic data file known as a shape file and a tabular data file known as an assignment file. The geographic file includes the boundaries for each district. The tabular data file includes one record for the lowest level of geography used to create the plan and the district to which it is assigned.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Users with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software may note a handful of instances in which the appearance of the geography assigned to each district may not match the legal boundaries. Notes follow on these instances below.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 As a general caveat, whatever the geographic representation might appear to be when the legislative plan is viewed via any software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definitions as submitted by the Joint Secretaries to the Ohio Apportionment Board. Those definitions can be found in this document.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition for House and Senate Districts that is wholly contained within the boundaries of a district but not contiguous to any district boundary, is assigned to that district. Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition that is contiguous to any district boundary is assigned to that district with which it has the longest continuous boundary. If two or more boundaries are of equal length, the area is assigned to the district with less population. All districts are contiguous including those that are contiguous only by bodies of water.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 The legal definition will be posted at the following website designated by the Ohio Apportionment Board: http:\/\/www.reshapeohio.org.\u00a0\u00a0 [link not valid as of 2\/13\/2015] Part B. Geographic Database\u00a0 The underlying geographic database used to create plans for legislative districts was developed by the Urban Center at Cleveland State University (CSU) in conjunction with the Voinovich Center at Ohio University (OU) as part of the project to develop the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database (OCURD). CSU was selected by bipartisan action by the co-chairs of the Ohio Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment and Demographic Research. The lowest level of geography in this database is not the census block but the split census block.\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 The overall purpose of the project was to accommodate for the fact that many census blocks contain portions of multiple higher levels of geography, such as a precinct or a municipality. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018split\u2019 units because they did not nest into the higher levels of geography. The project also enabled the creation of geographic layers for wards (which were not part of the census geographic products) and precincts that more closely reflect the boundaries used in the 2008 and 2010 elections.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 To create a geographic system that allowed for topological integrity, the OCURD project used the boundaries of the higher levels of geography as overlays and assigned the underlying census block, or portions thereof, to each of the higher levels. When the higher level geography crossed the census block, a new geographic unit was created known as a split block. It is this \u2018block split\u2019 layer of geography that was the lowest level of geography from which the legislative districts were created.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Another goal of the OCURD project was to estimate the population in each portion of the split blocks. The project researched several means by which this could be accomplished and chose a method based upon the length of the streets in each such block. Because the population was estimated for each portion, the number of persons was not rounded to a whole person and thus some fractional numbers will be found.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Another issue arose as the OCURD database was being used by the Joint Secretaries of the Ohio Apportionment Board to create legislative plans. This issue relates to the fact that many of the higher levels of geography, notably municipalities, wards, and precincts, contain multiple pieces of territory that are separated by distances short and long. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018non-contiguous areas\u2019 (NCA) because there is some other land or water between the pieces. There are two types of NCAs: those that are not contiguous because they are islands surrounded by water and those that are not contiguous because they are legally or technically a portion of a geographic unit but surrounded by other land-based geographic units. Examples of the first type are the islands off the coast of Lake Erie. Examples of the second type abound in the state.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 In most cases, the multi-part units are combined for geographic representation in GIS software. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018shapes\u2019 and are assigned to a district as one unit, even though there may be separate estimates of population for the blocks that comprise the higher level unit. Because they are combined as an entire shape they can only be assigned to one district by the GIS software used for the redistricting phase of the apportionment process. The software used by the Board to undertake this process was Maptitude for Redistricting (MTR) by Caliper Corporation.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 Requirements of the Ohio Constitution relate to both creating districts from contiguous territory and the maintenance of political subdivision boundaries. Therefore, making use of a multi-part area as the boundary of a district could present a situation in which a political subdivision would be split and a district would be created using non-contiguous territory.\u00a0 7.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever the geographic representation of the GIS software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definition as adopted by the Apportionment Board. 8.\u00a0\u00a0 Because some areas in the higher geographic levels are multi-part units the software flagged some districts as being non-contiguous. Notes on these situations follow.\u00a0 \u00a0Part C. Notes on Specific Districts:\u00a0 The following areas include districts that were designated by the Maptitude software as having some non-contiguous areas:\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 District 38\u2014Stark County. Block 391517147013085 is split into two pieces including portions of precincts 151ANY &amp; 151AEB. The portion in 151ANY contains no population and is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 District 46\u2014Lucas County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Jerusalem Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 District 48\u2014Stark County. Block 391517123002009 is split into three pieces including portions of precincts 151ACD, 151AME, and 151ANG. Each of these portions contains no population. The triangular portion at the lower south east of the block is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 District 55\u2014Lorain County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Avon Lake City. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 District 83\u2014Hardin and Logan Counties. There is one unit in the \u2018Block Split\u2019 layer, 390650007003086091AAR, that is unassigned in the map. It contains no population and is surrounded by district 83. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal description.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 District 88\u2014Sandusky County. One island is located in Sandusky Bay but is a portion of Riley Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.7.\u00a0\u00a0 District 89\u2014Ottawa County. This district has three components: the portion above Sandusky Bay; the portion below Sandusky Bay; and several islands off the Lake Erie coast.

School district boundaries were created based upon voter registration records to support various initiatives across multiple state agencies. CSU, NODIS used the school district assignment on the current voter registration record to establish where the district boundaries are. The address locations of voters will be assigned to the Census Bureau's TIGER geographic database and both automated and manual procedures implemented to create the school district boundaries. In addition, the school district names were updated by comparing and reconciling the names provided on the 2001-2002 Census file with those provided in the voter registration database. In 2007, this dataset was updated for 34 counties. The school district boundaries were created from county auditor supplied parcel boundary source data. The parcel boundaries were dissolved on tax district ids to form school district polygons. The resulting polygons were then conflated to centerline, railroad, hydrography, and political boundary data to form a complete school district layer covering the entire county. The data set was last updated in 2014.",

DAS Office of Real Estate can probably give a full list of leased locations. The agencies are currently certifying their data for the July 1st renewal. They are supposed to have all of their changes made by April 6th. I can send you an update at that time, if that will help. You will notice that some locations have records for multiple agencies, since we are now required by our carrier to specify contents and equipment values for each entity within the state building. Those records will show a $0 value for the building except for the building owner. We also have added underground tanks and pipes when the agency requests coverage for them.",

"dc_description_s": "This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",

The bedrock geology dataset was originally derived from the 1:24,000-scale bedrock-geology maps, that were created between 1989 through 1998. The bedrock-geology mapping program was initiated in the mid-1980s to perform detailed, 1:24,000-scale bedrock-geology maps. In 1991, the mapping approach was amended to a reconnaissance mapping methodology, but retaining the 1:24,000 scale. Both detail and reconnaissance bedrock-geologic maps were used as the basic information to compile the 1:500,000-scale, Bedrock Geologic Map of Ohio.",

It does not denote that a crime was committed. etails of point locations and crash details table are,Location points with some basic summary statistics,The DC ward the crash occurredSummary totals for: injuries (minor, major, fatal) by type (pedestrian, bicycle, car), mode of travel involved (pedestrian, bicycle, car), impaired participants (pedestrian, bicyclist, car passengers)If speeding was involvedNearest intersecting street nameDistance from nearest intersectionCardinal direction from the intersectionCrash details related table,Type of participant (driver, occupant, bicyclist, pedestrian)Age of participantsIf injured, severity (minor, major, fatal)Type of vehicle (passenger car, large truck, taxi, government, bicycle, pedestrian, etc)If persons issued a ticketIf a vehicle, the state (jurisdiction) license plate was issued (not license plate number)Are any persons deemed impaired Was person in vehicle where speeding was indicatedSome field definitions,CRIMEID - Unique ID for MPD crash report. This is a unique, database-generated ID.CCN - Criminal Complaint Number: a unique identifier assigned by MPD to each incident report. Other law enforcement agencies also request and use CCNs for their reports.REPORTDATE - The date the offense was reported to MPD, which may be later than the date the offense actually occurred.ROUTEID - The unique center line ID number that defines each street. A key part of the DDOT center line network.MEASURE - The measure is the distance along the DDOT center line (in meters) from the beginning of the street\/routeOFFSET - Offset distance (in meters) from the original latitude\/longitude location provided by MPD to the position located along the DDOT center line.STREETSEGID - a street block unique ID for a given road along a DDOT centerline. The street segments break at every street, This is the street segment ID at the crash location.ROADWAYSEGID - unique ID for a given road along a DDOT centerline. The roadway segments break at every street, alley, service road and ramp. This is the roadway segment ID at the crash location.MARID - For crashes that cannot be located using the MPD-supplied latitude\/longitude coordinates, DDOT attempts to locate the crash using the MPD-supplied nearest address. The address is processed against OCTO's Master Address Repository Web services to find the address latitude\/longitude coordinatesADDRESS - The MPD-supplied address associated to the crash. It's assumed that this is the nearest address to the crash location.WARD - DC Ward of the address location, which is supplied by the MAR.EVENTID - DDOT's internally managed LRS ID for the crash locationMAJORINJURIES* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverMINORINJURIES* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverFATAL* - Total number per pedestrian, bicyclist, driverIMPAIRED* - Total number impaired persons involvedTOTAL_TAXIS - Total number of taxis involved in the crash. NOTE: this does not include car-sharing vehicles such as Lyft or Uber.TOTAL_GOVERNMENT - Total number of DC, federal or other governmental vehicles involved in the crash.SPEEDING_INVOLVED - Indicates if the reporting officer believed speeding was a factor in the crash. NOTE: this doesn't necessarily equate to participants being ticketed\/cited for speeding.Questions on the contents of these layers should be emailed to Metropolitan Police Department or the DDOT Traffic Safety Division.

Led by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) in conjunction with the Office of Planning (OP) and the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Great Streets has grown into a multi-year, multi-agency program that utilizes public actions and resources to leverage private investment in retail, office space, housing, and cultural facilities across the District.The Government of the District of Columbia through the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) administers the Great Streets Retail Small Business Reimbursement Grants, which are competitive grants of up to $50,000 for qualified small business owners who wish to improve their place of business. The purpose of the grant program is to support existing small businesses, attract new businesses, increase the District's tax base, create new job opportunities for District residents, and transform emerging commercial corridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.If you would like to be added to the Great Streets email list to receive updates about small business opportunities in the District of Columbia, please email us at greatstreets@dc.gov.Visit http:\/\/greatstreets.dc.gov\/ for more information.",

Allbuildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures arefully ADA compliant and accessible. Itis the more natural features being identified in this layer. Many of these features are fully ADA codecompliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and areregularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with thelow-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-representedto a lower or no slope level. In naturalrustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearingcheck for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or othernaturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features. Therefore, features are frequently identifiedas no-slope or low-slope\/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADAcompliant. 'TheDNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify featuresand provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIScompatible layers provided here.

Find more information at 'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Access Control consists of linear features which specifically show the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Access Control is classified into three types, which are Full Control, Partial Control, and No Control. Roadway Access Control data is primarily used for general planning purposes, investment requirements modeling to calculate capacity and estimate type of design, in truck size and weight studies, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Access Control data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Access Control data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). Roadway Access Control data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies. Roadway Access Control data is key to understanding the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland.Roadway Access Control data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at 'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis.

For example, the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) traffic control officers who prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation. The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 40 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, where are the majority of Unsafe Operator moving violations in the AM Rush of 2014 These data will give up to 52 distinct street segments of information one for each week of the year.Field Definitions:Identification Weeknumber Week of Year, based on a Sunday start of the week StreetSeg Street Segment ID, corresponds to the DDOT street centerline StreetSegID field Registered Name Street nameStreetType Type of Street (Road, Ave, etc)Quad DC Quadrant FromAddLeft Unit number start (for approximating this segment s block) ToAddLeft Unit number end (for approximating this segment s blockMovingLow Speeding (Under 20mph) - speed violations under 20mphHigh Speeding (above 20mph) - speed violations over 20 mph including reckless drivingUnsafe Driving -violations for driving maneuvers unsafe to traffic Unsafe Vehicle - violations for vehicle characteristics unsafe to traffic Unsafe Operator- violations for operator (driver) characteristics unsafe to trafficOther- miscellaneous violationsImportant Notes: Records which could not be associated to a street centerline segment (StreetSeg) were excluded from these summariesRecords which do not have a time of day associated with the violation were excluded from these summaries.",

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of potential natural areas. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the 2004 Oakland County Natural Areas Report update. Each feature was assigned a priority of One, Two, or Three. Digital Landcover, orthophotography, and USGS quadrangle maps were the main sources used to identify each natural area. The data from the Oakland County Natural Areas update project was collected in 2004. Key attributes include Priority and TotalScore. Priority is a reflection of quality and indicates the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state of the identified area.The NaturalArea2004 data should be distributed with the Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004. This document provides essential information for the attributes and procedures used to create the features in the dataset.

Rasegan, RA, Charlotte P. Burckhardt, AICP, PCP, Lawrence S. Falardeau, RLA, Russell Lewis, RA, Leslie E. Kettren, AICP, Jim Keglovitz, and JoAnn Browning The Shiawassee and Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project involved six communities (Highland, Milford, Rose, Springfield, and White Lake Townships, and the Village of Milford) in western Oakland County. A Steering Committee composed of local officials, developers, property owners, and land conservancy members was the policy group that directed the project. The Steering Committee contracted with the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) to identify potentially significant natural areas. Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - July 2002 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Michael Penskar, Program Leader - Botany Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Michigan Natural Features Inventory P.O. Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 This report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in Oakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the landscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of potential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural features. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological services such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil development and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel corridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic diversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological value of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas can also be used to update and track the status of these remaining sites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local municipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize conservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. In this report the term potential natural area has been used in place of the term potential conservation area. The substitution was made in order to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites that are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better understanding of the term natural area. The term potential natural area, however, is not to be confused with the legal term dedicated Natural Area as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which gives land special legal protection.When using this information it is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a starting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, each community, group or individual using this information should determine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. Materials and Interpretation Methodology: Interpretation of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using digital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's Planning and Economic Development Services Division. As the townships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this imagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for Geographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b), and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These additional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the interpretation process. Delineation of sites was done through aerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) wetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested tracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done conservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up being eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of omitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated by focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much development (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as possible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads, parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural areas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal boundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the boundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all sites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. Following the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential natural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each site could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total calculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.",

Another community may have three commercial districts- Neighborhood Commercial, Hi-Tech Office, and Retail Commercial. A wide range of uses could be included in these categories, but for the purpose of this feature class, they are all translated into Commercial\/Office. In some cases a category on community's future land use map could not be translated into a single composite category. When this occurred, areas were manually translated into the appropriate generalized category. For example, a Public Lands class on a community's map would be manually translated into the Public\/Institutional and Recreation\/Conservation composite categories.",

These points were manually placed to represent the location of a conservation easement using tax parcels and orthophotography as a reference. Each easement location and associated attribute information was found through a recorded document search using Access Oakland. Key attributes include: GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page.This purpose of this data is general planning purposes and cartographic output. This data can also be used in conjunction with the MNFI Natural Areas feature class to identify moderate to high quality natural areas that are not protected.Each easement was located through Land Access, Oakland County's public records search tool. A search was conducted to find all recorded documents where the State of Michigan is the Grantee and the document type is an Easement (EST). In the Recorded Document Profile search within Land Access, three separate searches were performed to identify state recorded conservation easements: - State of Mi was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Michigan Dep was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Department was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. The legal description was used to identify the general location of the easement.Most often, these easements are created within a new residential development and may contain multiple conservation areas. In these cases, the point was placed in a general location within the subdivision to represent all the areas described in the conservation easement. The attribute information (i.e., GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page) was also collected through Land Access.Once complete, the dataset was verified internally and checked against information obtained from the Michigan Department of Environment Quality. We contacted David R. Dortman from the Land and Water Management Division who provided a list of the easements the state had record of. The list contained the Grantor, Liber, Page, and Acreage.",

"dc_title_s": "OC Development Authority: Oakland County, Michigan",
"dc_description_s": "The DevelopmentAuthority polygon feature class identifies certain types of entities that encourage development\/redevelopment in designated areas. This feature class currently represents Downtown Development Authorities (DDA), Tax Increment Finance Authorities (TIFA), and Local Development Finance Authorities (LDFA); however, it will also depict Corridor Improvement Authorities (CIA) and Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (BRA) in the future. These five types of authorities have the ability to capture tax increment financing (TIF).The features were digitized using legal descriptions, parcel lists, and maps that were provided to the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal and\/or Oakland County Equalization by the authority. The key attributes are Name (official name of the authority), Type (the type of development authority), and DevelopmentPlan (yes\/no indicating if the feature represents an area that is part of a development plan and can caputre tax increment financing).Tax Increment Financing is a tool used to promote redevelopment and community improvement projects by channeling funding toward projects in targeted areas. TIF is captured from the increase of property values from a base year. Millage rates from taxing jurisdictions are applied to the increased value. The resulting tax revenue is directed to the authority, rather than the appropriate jurisdiction.Beginning in 1994, taxing jurisdictions have the option to opt out of having its taxes captured by the authority. Also since 1994, school taxes may no longer be captured unless they are necessary to make payments on existing eligible obligations. For more information about TIF, see Michigan Department of Treasury's Tax Increment Financing FAQ web page at http:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/treasury\/0,1607,7-121-3218---F,00.html. The State of Michigan has adopted enabling legislation to allow TIF through five types of authorities. Each type of authority has a focus relating to development\/redevelopment: Downtown Development Authority (PA 197 of 1975)'Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districts Tax Increment Finance Authority (PA 450 of 1980)Prevent urban deteriorationEncourage economic development and activityEncourage neighborhood revitalization and historic preservationClosed to new applicants since 1987Allows the development of virtually any type of land use Local Development Finance Authority (PA 281 of 1986)Encourage local developmentPromote conditions of employmentPromote economic growthLimited to business activities involving:ManufacturingAgricultural processingHigh-technology activitiesEnergy productionBusiness incubators Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (PA 381 of 1996)Promote revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain propertyFocus on tax reverted, blighted, or functionally obsolete propertyMDEQ must approve brownfield redevelopment areas Corridor Improvement Authority (PA 281 of 2005)Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districtsMust be adjacent to a road classified as an arterial or collectorThese quasi-public entities are created by resolution through a community's governing body. CIA and LDFA boundaries may cross municipal boundaries. In the case of these multi-jurisdictional authorities, both communities must pass resolutions establishing authority. There is currently only one Joint LDFA (Cities of Southfield and Troy) and there are no CIAs in Oakland County. When the community establishes the authority, it must also define the geographic boundaries in which it will operate. DDAs and CIAs are authorized to levy and collect taxes through a special assessment on all properties within the authority boundary.After the authority and its boundaries are established, the authority creates a tax increment financing and development plan. The plan estimates the amount of tax increment financing that will be captured and lists specific projects on which it will be spent. It also defines the development area where the tax increment financing and projects will occur. The development area must be completely within the authority boundary; however, it may be coincident with the authority boundary.An authority may contain multiple development areas, each with its own development and tax increment financing plan. BRAs normally designate development areas as a one or two parcels for a specific development project, while the other types of authorities define development areas as a larger area. Also, LDFAs are only allowed to capture TIF from parcels in a permitted use, such as manufacturing.There may be both eliglible and inelgible parcels within a development area; however, the inelgible parcels do not participate in TIF capture. The base year used to calculate the amount of tax increment financing is set when the development plan is adopted. If the development plan is expanded at a later date, the base year could be reset for the entire development area or the capture could be calculated using multiple base years.The source for the base year was the tax billing code used by Oakland County Equalization. When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford'Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and\/or map.For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.The data will be updated on an as needed basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments. In particular, county departments may not be aware of BRA development projects when no TIF is captured. Lastly, because the tax parcel feature class is revised periodically and it is important for the features to be coincident with the tax parcel feature class, the development authority feature class will also be updated annually to correct conflicts due to parcel shifting.",

The two major uses are cartographic output and creating summaries at various spatial extents.The intent of this feature class was to provide a very general representation of a hard copy 1966 land use map.  The spatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature was limited by the intended purpose of the data.The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land use map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater than 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire county was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on the Landuse.Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the following process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was modifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were buffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from RoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two types (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent property was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County Register of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in liber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that simultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in 1966.  Major roads that intersected or were adjacent with these simultaneous conveyances were classified as Dedicated and the remainder of Major Roads were classified as a Perscriptive Easement.  The buffer distances, representing half the total Right-of-Way width, used for each road code are listed below:     Minor Road - 30 feet     Major Road (Perscriptive Easement) - 33 feet     Major Road (Dedicated) - 46.5 feet     State Highway - 46.5 feetU.S. Highway - 46.5 feet     Interstate - 60 feet feetThese Right-of-Way widths generally approximate those that actually existed in 1966 and are not intended to indicate the exact width of a specific Right-of-Way.  All areas completely surrounded by Right-of-Way such as between directions of travel of a boulevard or interstate or the area inside of a freeway interchange were manually attributed as Right-of-Way.Water features were burned in the final feature class using a modified version the of the Oakland County Waterbody feature class.  This data was modified to reflect waterbodies in 1966 using the 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.Lastly, the features that intersected community boudaries were split using the Identity tool to increase cartographic and analytic performance.",

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use.  The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class.  Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information.  The data was collected in 2001. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number).  Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.  The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space.

"dc_description_s": "A  spatial representation of land use.  The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class.  Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information.  The data was collected in 2002. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number).  Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.  The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2002 version of land use was created using the 2001 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space).

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2006. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2006 version of land use was created using the 2005 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for the 2006 update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in August 2010. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2010 version of land use was created using the 2009 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for the 2010 update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land use. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2014. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2015 version of land use was created using the 2013 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels. The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset. Assumptions: In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update. Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), and park. The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial\/Office. Uses may also fall into Public\/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification. The Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial\/Office, or Mobile Home Park. The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, Public\/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW. Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions: There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel vacant.

"dc_description_s": "This polygon feature class represents the spatial extent of surficial geology deposits, glacial and sub-glacial drainage, and historical glacial lake shoreline areas in Oakland County. These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. The key attribute is the geologic sediment type.The primary business purpose for the development of this data set was to collaborate with the Cranbrook Institute of Science in producing an educational map about the surficial geology of Oakland County at a scale appropriate to Countywide and sub-County applications. Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972.

Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. Zawiskie QC'd the data through visual inspections of plots, and Nina Misuraca instituted the corrections.",

"dc_title_s": "Oil and Gas Fields of Ohio: Ohio",
"dc_description_s": "These maps and database are an update of the Ohio Division of Geological Survey (ODGS) oil and gas fields Digital Chart and Map Series (DCMS 13 through 21), which was completed in 1996. Previous Ohio oil and gas fields maps were also published in 1948, 1953, 1960, 1964, and 1974. The updated maps and database have been created using the GIS-based ESRI\/ARCMAP software. All documented oil and gas pools\/fields have been digitized as polygons and each polygon is linked to a unique pool\/field identification (ID) number and name. Like the previous DCMS oil and gas fields maps, the updated oil and gas pools\/fields have been grouped into 8 major plays defined by specific stratigraphic intervals. These are the 1) Pennsylvanian undifferentiated sandstones and coals, 2) Mississippian undifferentiated sandstones (excluding the Berea and Cussewago Sandstone) and Maxville Limestone, 3) Mississippian Berea and Cussewago sandstones), 4) Upper Devonian Ohio Shale and siltstones, 5) Silurian\/Devonian Big Lime interval (Onondaga Limestone, Oriskany Sandstone, Bass Islands Dolomite, Salina Group, and Lockport Dolomite), 6) Silurian Cataract\/ Medina sandstone (Clinton\/Medina) and Dayton Formation (Packer Shell), 7) Middle Ordovician fractured shale, Trenton Limestone and Black River Group and Wells Creek Formation, and 8) Cambrian-Ordovician Knox Dolomite (Beekmantown dolomite, Rose Run sandstone, Copper Ridge dolomite, B-zone, and Krysik sandstone). All oil and gas pool\/field ID's are defined and grouped by play and not geographic boundary, since most of the producing oil and gas reservoirs in Ohio occur within stratigraphic traps. This is a departure from the method used in the 1974 map in which oil and gas fields were assigned geographically, and not by producing horizon. Thus on the 1974 map, one field could contain multiple, stacked, partially overlapping, producing horizons from the Cambrian to the Pennsylvanian. Since the 1974 map was produced, over 58,000 additional wells have been drilled and completed in multiple, stacked producing horizons, mostly in unique stratigraphic traps. This has made it too cumbersome to assign all producing horizons to the same pool\/field ID within any given geographic area. Assignment of pool\/field ID's by play or stratigraphic interval provides a better geologic method of displaying and defining these pools\/fields that are dominantly stratigraphic traps. With this method of outlining polygons for producing horizons, a pool is defined as a single polygon that produces from horizons within one play. When more than one polygon is assigned the same ID within the same play, these polygons are defined as a field. Pool\/field production types are displayed as gas (red), oil (green), or storage (orange). In most cases, the assignment of production type was determined from the 1974 Ohio oil and gas field map. For updates to the 1974 map, the production type (excluding the Knox Dolomite play) was determined by the dominance of oil or gas symbol as displayed on the township well spot maps. In many cases a subjective decision was made, since many of the wells are displayed as combination oil and gas. With the Knox Dolomite play, the production type was based on gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) using data from the ODGS production database POGO (Production of Oil and Gas in Ohio). Oil production is shown for pools\/fields with a GOR less than 5,000, and gas for fields with a GOR greater than 5,000. Calculations are based on cumulative production since 1984. This method of using GOR was not possible for the other, older historical plays because of insufficient production data. Whenever possible, existing outlines from the 1996 digital oil and gas fields maps were used. Exceptions to this are in areas where the 1996-pool\/field boundaries were modified or new pool\/field boundaries were created from additional drilling. Pool\/field boundaries were digitized based upon documented wells from the ODGS township well spot maps, and in some areas from the Ohio Fuel Gas (OFG) well spot maps. The OFG maps were used primarily for the Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays because many of these older wells are not located on the ODGS township well spot maps. In some areas, digitized pools\/fields from the 1996 version were deleted if the oil and gas township and\/or the OFG maps or well cards could not verify them. A minimum of 3 producing wells within a 1-mile distance was required to draw a pool\/field outline. Storage field outlines are approximate and are based primarily on the 1974 map. In drawing new polygons for pool\/field boundaries, a buffer of 1\/2 mile was made around each producing well, and boundaries were drawn using these buffers. In assigning pool\/field ID's, the historical numbers and names from the 1974 map were maintained whenever possible. Pools\/fields may be consolidated into a larger consolidated field only if they occur within the same play. When two or more pools\/fields are consolidated, they were assigned a new field ID. The name of the consolidated field was taken from the oldest pool\/field within the consolidated field. There may be exceptions to this if the name is firmly entrenched in literature (i.e., Canton Consolidated, East Canton Consolidated, etc.). In a given geographic area of multiple producing horizons, the same ID was maintained for the dominant producing horizon. The less dominant producing horizons in other plays for this geographic area were assigned new pool\/field ID's. Every pool\/field with an assigned number has also been assigned a unique name. If it is a new pool\/field ID that was not on the 1974 map, a new name was assigned using the nearest place name (i.e., town, village, city, etc.) or a named geographic feature (i.e., stream, river, ridge, etc.) from a topographic map.",

The last mapping effort of the lowest USDW was performed in 1982. In excess of 37,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled since that date without significant updates to the mapping. Further, the 1982 mapping was hand-drawn on paper maps, which are not easily reproducible or updated. Existing water-quality data have been collected and correlated to bedrock geology. The resultant data are being used to produce structure contour maps on the base of the lowest mappable, consolidated (i.e., bedrock) unit designated as a USDW. Surface casing is always required through unconsolidated surficial deposits, whose depths are known from other mapping projects. All information has been compiled and mapped digitally for ease of distribution and future updating. Industry will be able to use these maps and data to correctly estimate the length and cost of casing required for each well prior to submitting a permit application.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. These data provide restoration value rankings and ecological attributes associated with green infrastructure gaps. The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - hubs and corridors. Gaps are developed, agricultural, mined, or cleared lands within the Green infrastructure network that could be targeted for restoration. These were evaluated for their potential restoration to forest, wetland, or riparian buffers, by considering watershed condition, landscape position, local features, ownership, and programmatic considerations. Gaps with hydric soils were probably once wetlands, and could be restored as such. Reforestation of gaps along streams would not only benefit wildlife, but improve water quality and stream stability.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Harford County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Harford County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s NOAA National Shoreline data sets and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

Shoreline Situation Reports (SSR) were first generated by VIMS in the 1970s to report the condition and status of the shore lands. The SSR series were published in hardcopy on a county by county basis for each of the Tidewater Virginia localities. The reports were intended to assist planners, managers, and regulators in decisions pertaining to management of coastal areas and natural resources therein. The techniques developed for Virginia's shoreline are used to create similar reports for the Maryland shoreline. Data collected describes conditions in the immediate riparian zone, the bank, and along the shore. These data should not be used for jurisdictional permit determinations beyond providing general shoreline condition or status information. These data have not been surveyed to property boundaries.

This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. Last Updated: 1992",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1960-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1960s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 40-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2\/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. Bathymetry for Chesapeake Bay was derived from two hundred ninety-seven surveys containing 3,178,509 soundings. Thirty-five older, less accurate, overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older, less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918, thirty-seven from the 1930s, ninety-one from the 1940s, sixty- six from the 1950s, twenty-five from the 1960s, twenty-four from the 1970s, fourteen from the 1980s, and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3. 7 meters to -50. 4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0. 2 and 1. 2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7. 5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7. 5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7. 5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7. 5- by 7. 5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7. 5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete. This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details. Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data. Last Updated: 6\/6\/1998",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Harford County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Harford County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s MGS shoreline and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1972-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38thStreet bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

This conflated baseline consist of two Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Process runs. The original In 2000, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal Zone Management grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland -- the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI), currently of Frederick, Md. , to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). The 2000 baseline which were not created seaward includes all Maryland shoreline areas except for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Harford and Prince George's counties currently. The newest (2015) updated baselines were created offshore (seaward) of the shorelines utilized in DSAS analysis. The baselines were created by 1) buffering at a distance of 10m around the master shoreline feature class converting the buffer polygon to a line, and erasing the landward portion of the buffer line; and 2)manually digitizing baselines up the centerline of tributaries\/rivers and other areas where baselines were needed but the buffer-created baselines did not reach.

The Green Infrastructure Assessment was developed to provide decision support for Maryland's Department of Natural Resources land conservation programs. Methods used to identify and rank green infrastructure lands are intended soley for this use. Other applications are at the discretion of the user. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - hubs and corridors. Hubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and\/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres. Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or most natural routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.

The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions\/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions\/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2\/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

The TW_8DigitShed feature class is the official geospatial representation depicting tidal 8-digit watershed assessments as described in Maryland's 2014 Integrated Report (IR) of Surface Water Quality. In general, tidal assessments in the Chesapeake Bay are made at the salinity segment scale. However, some older assessments and impairments that are valid in 2014, still use the old 8-digit watershed boundaries. In order to accurately capture this assessment scale, this feature class was created. In general, IR assessments at tidal 8-digit watershed scale include assessments for PCBs in fish tissue and metals. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.",

This shoreline feature class consists of twenty separate shoreline data sets, located in Anne Arundel County, compiled from various sources, and spanning 1932-2010. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shorelines were acquired online from the 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/t-sheets. html), 2) the NOAA National Shoreline data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/index. html), and 3) the NOAA Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) data set (http:\/\/shoreline. noaa. gov\/data\/datasheets\/cusp. html). The ca. 1940 Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) shorelines were extracted in the early 1990s from Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of NOAA. MGS digitized these shorelines directly from bromide or mylar copies of the Coastal Survey maps. The ca. 1990 MGS shorelines were digitized by EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, MD in 2000. EDI extracted the shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). This shoreline feature class was created by appending the twenty individual shoreline data sets into one master shoreline feature class file, and retains the original attribute field names from the twenty input files. As such, the original attribute information for each input dataset is part of this final shoreline feature class. MGS also created seven additional attribute fields, some which are required for DSAS analysis and some of which facilitated general data management\/analysis -- DSAS_DATE, DSAS_UNC, DSAS_SRC, DSAS_DEC, DSAS_CO, DSAS_NPROJ, and DSAS_SLINF. Here is a list of the individual data sets (by source) compiled for this master shoreline feature class (all data sets clipped to county boundaries): 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data sets -- CM7202; 2) NOAA National Shoreline data sets -- CS288, MD1932A1, MD1932A2, MD1932A3, MD1932B, MD1933D, MD1933E, MD1933F, MD1934A, CS307, MD1941A1, PH6008, PH6009A, PH6609, CM7415, and CM7601; 3) MGS data sets -- 1940 and 1990 MGS shoreline; and 4) NOAA CUSP data set.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. SSURGO DownloaderClick on a watershed to get a pop-up and start the download processNo longer do you have to spend time learning about the SSURGO database structure before you can use the data. No longer do you have to figure out how to import the data into the ArcGIS system to get your job done. Use this web map to download map packages created from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) that the Esri Soils Team has extracted and prepared for immediate use in your maps and analyses. The Esri Soils Team created a map with 130 of the most useful variables in SSURGO. The data are packaged by subbasin (HUC8 from the Watershed Boundary Dataset) and are available through this web map. The SSURGO data selected for this application consist of basic descriptions of the data (from the Map Unit Feature Class and Map Unit tables), a collection of interpretations (from the MUAGGATT table), and aggregated information about the components of each map unit (Component table). We chose these data because they represent the most commonly used fields in SSURGO and many of these values serve as standard inputs to assessment and modeling processes. Included in the map package is a zip folder containing 19 layer files to symbolize the data. The layer files contain the symbology from the Soil Mobile and Web Maps Group on ArcGIS. com. To access the folder use the Extract Package tool in the Data Management Toolbox then open the folder containing the extracted map package in Windows Explorer and navigate to commondata userdata and unzip the LayerFiles. zip folder. Data from the four SSURGO tables were assembled into the single table included in each map package. Data from the component table were aggregated using a dominant component model (listed below under Component Table Dominant Component) or a weighted average model (listed below under Component Table Weighted Average) using custom Python scripts. The the Mapunit table, the MUAGATTAT table and the processed Component table data were joined to the Mapunit Feature Class. Field aliases were added and indexes calculated. A field named Map Symbol was created and populated with random integers from 1-10 for symbolizing the soil units in the map package.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data. The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and\/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s). Last Updated: Unknown",

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and\/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. Last Updated: Unknown",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set.

Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a baseline landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs, DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect. Last Updated: Unknown",

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. The results of SLAMM were analyzed for specific conservation criteria for long-term planning that may help increase coastal resiliency in Maryland. The conservation criteria included areas that may support future wetland migration, wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors, high priority aquatic and terrestrial living resources, vulnerable wetland habitat, suitable hydric soils for wetland establishment and marsh-dependent breeding bird habitat. From these criteria a conservation model was developed to prioritize the most important areas for wetland adaptation. As a result the top priorities were used to create the Wetland Adaptation Areas for the Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) used in Marylands GreenPrint.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Anne Arundel County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Anne Arundel County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Anne Arundel County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County in 2007. In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion.

This feature class is linked by relationship class to data from the 2014 Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality. This link allows for users to query water quality assessment information spatially and facilitates the development of other customized visuals. This feature class is built upon the Chesapeake Bay Program's salinity segmentation scheme and Maryland's coverage for the Coastal Bays. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.",

The SSR series were published in hardcopy on a county by county basis for each of the Tidewater Virginia localities. The reports were intended to assist planners, managers, and regulators in decisions pertaining to management of coastal areas and natural resources therein. The techniques developed for Virginia's shoreline are used to create similar reports for the Maryland shoreline. Data collected describes conditions in the immediate riparian zone, the bank, and along the shore.

"dc_title_s": "Shoreline Changes - Prince Georges 10 Years Shoreline Erosion Level: Maryland",
"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2010 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4. 3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Prince George's County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Prince George's County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Prince George's County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000\/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0. 01 to 0. 01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0. 01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Prince George's County in 2007. In Prince George s County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 60% of the shoreline in the county. MGS decided to supplement the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Anacostia River, from approximately the Bladensburg Road bridge, north to the Decatur Street bridge; Northwest Branch Anacostia River, from approximately the 38thStreet bridge, south to its confluence with the Anacostia River; the lower reaches of Swanson Creek, west of Chalk Point; Spice Creek and an unnamed creek north of Spice Creek; and Patuxent River and its major tributaries, from approximately the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to the upper reaches of the Patuxent River. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.

These are the statistical counterparts of incorporated places, and are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials and generally updated prior to each decennial census. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs.",

The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

The six files combined contain information on over 575,000 spatially verified water well records. The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

The six files combined contain information on over 575,000 spatially verified water well records. The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula, Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields. Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",
