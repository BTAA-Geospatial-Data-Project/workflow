As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U. S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System, which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence, you will see the same acreage, BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project. This file consists of stateside POS projects only.",

These baseline recreational use data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, future planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways the Chesapeake waters and surrounding lands are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The areas in this data set were derived from sitings called in and tracked by Steve Doctor at Matapeake. These sitings were located as points on a map that were contributed by Mr. Doctor and Nancy Butowski, DNR Fisheries Service. Professional guidance was provided by Nancy Butowski and Steve Doctor. The areas were then located on the VIMS shoreline data set and exported as an independent data set. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county. Last Updated: 06\/29\/2010",

As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is collecting information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Maryland. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U. S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for its Atlantic Coast and Coastal Bays. So basic data on how we use our coastal waters will be collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

The U. S. National Grid provides a standardized grid reference system that is seamless across jurisdictional boundaries and allows for pinpointing exact locations. Since USNG is standardized, it can be understood and used as a common geographic framework for response. Zone 18S covers part of Maryland. The vertical UTM boundaries are horizontal latitude band boundaries form (generally) 6 X 8 Grid Zones. Hence, the first three letters of the MGRS value, e. g. 18S , are referred to as the Grid Zone Designator (GZD). The fourth and fifth characters are a pair of letters identifying one of the 100,000-meter grid squares within the grid zone (or UPS area). The S in this instance is not to be confused with UTM Zone 18S for UTM in the Southern Hemisphere. There are no classification restrictions on this information.

In 2000, the Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) was awarded a Coastal ZoneManagement grant to complete the acquisition of a recent (ca. 1990) digital shoreline for the coastal regions of Maryland - the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, the coastal bays, and the Atlantic coast. MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, Md. , to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3. 75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available, EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, NAD 83, meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors. Following shoreline extraction or interpretation, EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type: beach, vegetated, structure, or water's edge. This data set has been merged into a state wide file for ease of processing and decision making. Last Updated: 2003",

Anything below a BIBI score of 3. 0 is red (Poor), 3. 0-3. 9 is yellow (Fair), and 4. 0-5. 0 is green (Good). Begun as a pilot in 2000, Maryland Stream Waders is a statewide volunteer stream monitoring program managed by Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Monitoring and Nontidal Assessment Division. Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others. Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each), while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus, Stream Waders data should help fill the gaps left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS. Stream Waders sample, for the most part, in the sameoverall watersheds each year where MBSS crews sample. Last Updated: 09\/2012",

Including Baltimore City makes a total of 17 designated locations based on sixteen County Boundaries and one City Boundary. Four main models were created to perform the overlay processes to calculate the Zonal Majority used to determine the total rank for all the segments. The Blue Infrastructure assessment was designed as a spatial evaluation of coastal habitat, critical natural resources and associated human uses in the tidal waters and near-shore areas of Maryland's coastal zone. The Assessment is used to identify near-shore tidal habitat priority areas that support coastal habitats and the resources and economies that depend upon them. The Blue Infrastructure was developed through a partnership between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Chesapeake and Coastal Program, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Towson University's Center for GIS.

The feature layer supports Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) leadership and planners as they endeavor to mitigate or prevent the infrastructure impacts of sea level change resulting from land surface subsidence and rising sea levels. The product forecasts areas of inundation and represents the new zero elevation for the future scenario. Methodology: US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided the sea level change (SLC) estimate-1. SLC was localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying-2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations were transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land subsidence was applied to create an SLC value for the official project year, 2015. The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified bathtub model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the local minima were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and\/or Chesapeake Bay influence. -1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve. See http:\/\/www. corpsclimate. us\/ccaceslcurves. cfmfor more detail. -2 Closest station with historic records of 40 years or greater.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.

"dc_title_s": "Archived Water Quality - Archived Tier II Quality Waters 2012: Maryland",
"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap. maryland. gov. The Clean Water Act requires three components to water quality standards that set goals for and protect each States' waters. The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e. g. , recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e. g. , bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26. 08. 02. 04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26. 08. 02. 04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4. 00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse. The publicly maintained list of all Tier II waters and for further information regarding Maryland's High Quality Waters, Tier II, please visit http:\/\/mde. maryland. gov\/programs\/Water\/TMDL\/Integrated303dReports\/Pages\/Antidegradation. aspxAcknowledgement of the Maryland Department of the Environment, Science Services Administration as a data source would be appreciated in products developed from these data, and such acknowledgement as is standard for citation and legal practices for data sources is expected by users of this data.

Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. The Marsh Protection Potential Index (MPPI) ranks Maryland s coastal marshes by their ability to protect vulnerable communities from coastal hazards. To do so, we identified five key questions to assess each marsh: How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat Is the marsh located where there are people to protect Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources, we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then, the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating, which ranks the protective ability of over 14,000 marshes statewide. It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes, rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh, nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition, the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity, ecosystem health, rare species, recreation value, or water quality services are often important to stakeholders, and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement, not replace, the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats. Last Updated: 3\/31\/2016",

Protection is provided through the acquisition of easements and fee estates from willing landowners and the supporting activities of Rural Legacy Sponsors and local governments. This file consists of properties that have been protected using Rural Legacy funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project.

Coefficients of Variation (CVs), which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate, are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data. The unit of geography used for the 2010 - 2014 data is the census tract - a small statistical area within a county, which is delineated every 10 years prior to the decennial census.

"dc_description_s": "This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov. Program Open Space (POS) acquires recreation and open space areas for public use. The Program administers funds made available to local communities for open and recreational space through the State real estate transfer tax and from federal programs, such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund of the National Park Service, U. S. Department of the Interior. The Program coordinates the acquisition of lands for the use of all units of DNR. Stateside POS funds are allocated to purchase land for state parks, forests, wildlife habitat, natural, scenic and cultural resources for public use. A portion of stateside funds are also dedicated to capital improvements, critical maintenance, and operations in state parks. Stateside POS projects are now being driven by a new Targeting System, which uses the best scientific information available to target the program's limited funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project. Hence, you will see the same acreage, BPW amount and TEA result for each part of the project. This file consists of stateside POS projects only.",

Phase I consistedof a statistical evaluation and refinement of New Jersey Transit?s existing transit scoremethod. This included a regression analysis to test the relationships between existingvariables, additional variables, and transit mode share for the region, the State of NewJersey, and the combined area of the two. Based on the results of this evaluation, arefined transit score equation was derived for congruent use in both New Jersey andPennsylvania. This DVRPC Transit Score Tool is as follows (all densities gross):Transit score = [0.41*(Population per acre)] +[0.09*(Jobs per acre)] +[0.74*(Zero car households per acre)]The DVRPC Transit Score Tool was then classified into five score category ranges (from?low? to ?high?):Low:  7.5The TAZ boundaries used in this file are the TAZ boundaries submitted to the Census Bureau in 2012.

The TIGER\/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File \/ Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF\/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and\/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and\/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business\/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",

Zonal percentile statistics were also calculated on buffered features for each raster to obtain the 90th percentile building heights (HEIGHT_ESTIMATE field).All output statistics fields were joined to the original input feature class (with unit conversions applied, where necessary).A complete dataset, which includes the following fields that are populated with various statistical outputs generated during the building height estimation process, is available upon request:HEIGHT_PCT90 ? 90th percentile value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.HEIGHT_PCT50 ? median value of all cells in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.HEIGHT_COUNT ? total number of cells with tabulated values in the nDSM raster located within the building footprint.SLOPE_MEAN ? average of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.SLOPE_STD ? standard deviation of all cells in the slope raster located within the building footprint.SLOPE_COUNT - total number of cells with tabulated values in the slope raster located within the building footprint.",

"dc_description_s": "The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) contracted Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) to perform a 2015 Land Use Update (aka Phase 1, Product 1, P1) and to create a 2015 Enhanced Land Use Update (aka Phase 2, Product 2, P2) data set for the nine-county DVRPC region consisting of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania, and Camden, Burlington, Gloucester, and Mercer counties in New Jersey. The project started in February 2016 and completed in April 2017. AIS used computer interactive photo interpretation and heads-up digitizing to create both land use datasets. The project was performed in two phases.This metadata is for the Enhanced Land Use (P2) mapping effort.The P2 layer was the creation of an enhanced land use layer using a more detailed land use classification and standardized data capture criteria, including minimum mapping size guidelines for built-up land use types and parking lots. The P2 layer will support DVRPC?s more detailed planning analyses goals and other programs and projects at DVRPC and their member governments and agencies.Despite some overlap in the land use classification and data capture criteria for each effort, the P1 and P2 geodatabases do not completely correlate to one another due to the more detailed P2 classification, changes in the categorization of some land use features from P1 to P2 and revisions to the original DVRPC data capture criteria.All work was performed by AIS staff, at the AIS office in Redlands, California using Esri ArcGIS 10.3 software capabilities. No sub-contractors or outside consultants were used throughout the performance of the contract.Detailed Metadata Document",

"dc_description_s": "DVRPC Connections 2040 Planning Areashttp:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/asp\/pubs\/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=13042Greater Philadelphia is a complex mosaic of 352 diverse cities, boroughs,and townships. Connections 2040 characterizes each of the region?smunicipalities as either a Core City, Developed Community, Growing Suburb, orRural Area, as a means of categorizing the types of communities and definingthe corresponding long-range planning policies most appropriate for each type.This categorization is shown on the Planning Areas and Centers dataset. Many municipalities have areas within their boundaries that fit thecharacteristics of more than one of these Planning Area types. GloucesterTownship (in Camden County, New Jersey), for example, has neighborhoods thatare fully developed, but it also has a significant number of undeveloped acresand forecasted population and employment growth more characteristic of aGrowing Suburb. The intent of the Plan is to assign to each municipality theplanning area type associated with the long-range planning policies that willbe most bene fi cial to the entire community. While the Planning Areas andCenters map is a guide for policy direction at the regional scale, actualapproaches should always be guided by local conditions.The region?s four Core Cities are Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, andChester. Targeted infrastructure investment, maintenance and rehabilitation,comprehensive neighborhood revitalization, and efforts focused on reinforcing anetwork of social and educational programs will help to rebuild and revitalizethe region?s cities.Developed Communities are places that have already experienced most oftheir population and employment growth, and include inner ring communitiesadjacent to the Core Cities; railroad boroughs and trolley car communities; andmature suburban townships. Many of these communities are stable and thriving,offering affordable housing opportunities; access to transit; safe pedestrianand bicycling environments; and a strong community identity. Others, however,are experiencing population and employment losses; have deterioratinginfrastructure systems; have aging resident populations living on limitedincomes; and have stagnant or declining tax bases that cannot keep pace withrising service demands. Rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructuresystems and the housing stock, and local economic and community development canhelp to reinforce location advantages, while stabilizing neighborhoods andstemming decline.Growing Suburbs are communities that have a significant number ofdevelopable acres remaining and are experiencing or are forecast to experiencesignificant population and\/or employment growth. Key planning policies in thesecommunities focus on the need to improve the form of development, reducecongestion, and mitigate the negative consequences of unmanaged growth, andinclude growth management and enhanced community design. Smart growthtechniques that support a more concentrated development pattern (such asclustering, mixed uses, transit-oriented development, and transfer ofdevelopment rights) can provide the critical mass necessary to support newtransit services and other alternatives to the automobile. The quality ofdesign and architectural character of the built environment, open spacepreservation, and the creation of an integrated system of open space andrecreation are all priorities in these communities.Rural Areas include the region?s agricultural communities and communitieswith large remaining natural areas. Key policy approaches for these communitiesfocus on preservation and limiting development, and include limited expansionof infrastructure systems, preservation of a rural lifestyle and villagecharacter, support for continued farming, and enhanced natural resourceprotection. Livable communities in these areas include rural centers that havean identi fi able main street, a mix of uses, higher densities than theirsurrounding uses, and a true sense of place.",

"dc_description_s": "DVRPC Connections 2040 Planning Centers, Core Cities,  Neighborhood Centershttp:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/asp\/pubs\/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=13042The concept of Centers is the cornerstone of Connections 2040. Centers provide a focal point in the regional landscape that recognizes the regional and local significance of places, while reinforcing a sense of community for local residents. Centers serve as a basis for organizing and focusing the development landscape and provide a framework for the most efficient provision of supportive infrastructure systems, including water, sewer, and transportation. By concentrating growth around and within Centers, the region can both preserve open space and reduce infrastructure costs. The densities and mixed uses inherent within Centers can enhance the feasibility of walking, bicycling, and public transit as alternatives to the automobile. Connections 2040 identifies a hierarchy of seven Center types, shown on the Planning Areas and Centers map, based on their role and activities within the region.METROPOLITAN CENTERCenter City\/University City\/Camden Central Business District ? spanning the Delaware River and bounded roughly by 40th Street from Girard to Washington avenues in Philadelphia and by the Ben Franklin Bridge and Interstate 676 to Clinton Street in Camden ? is identified as the region?s Metropolitan Center. This dense, compact, mixed-use area includes the central business districts of Philadelphia and Camden, major academic and medical institutions, and major tourist and entertainment destinations.METROPOLITAN SUBCENTERSThe Plan also identifies six Metropolitan Subcenters, reflecting their magnitude of jobs and commercial activity. These include the downtown area of Trenton and the destinations of King of Prussia\/Valley Forge (Montgomery and Chester counties); International Airport (Delaware and Philadelphia counties), Navy Yard\/Sports Complex (Philadelphia); Cherry Hill\/Mount Laurel\/Marlton (Burlington and Camden counties); and the Route 1 Corridor (Mercer County).NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERSConnections 2040recognizes that each of the region?s Core Cities is a collection of diverse neighborhoods with varying characteristics, assets, challenges, and needs, and that specific approaches and strategies for improving and revitalizing these neighborhoods will differ. The planning policies within the Core Cities and their neighborhoods focus on redevelopment and revitalization through targeted investment and reinvestment. Embedded within the region?s Core Cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, Camden, and Chester are Neighborhood Centers, which are recognizable places with a mix of commercial, retail, anchor institutional, and residential activities. Neighborhood Centers have an identifiable main street or focal point, are walkable, and have a unique history or sense of a community within the larger city setting. In addition to the metropolitan center, metropolitan subcenters, and neighborhood centers, the Plan identifies four other types of Centers: Suburban Centers, Town Centers, Rural Centers, and Planned Centers. The characteristics of each type are as follows:SUBURBAN CENTERSAre regionally significant; While not necessarily single municipalities, are perceived as single ?places;? Are suburban in character; Are less dense than town centers; Lack the integrated mix of uses found in town centers;Are defined primarily by a concentration and variety of office, retail, professional, and light industrial uses, and generally have more jobs than residents; and are generally auto dependent rather than transit oriented or pedestrian scale.TOWN CENTERSHave a mixture of high-density residential and commercial land use; Have an integrated mix of land uses;Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than their surrounding land uses;Have a distinct downtown\/main street area surrounded by relatively dense residential development; Are pedestrian friendly and often transit oriented; and Are surrounded by suburban land uses.RURAL CENTERSHave a minimum density of six people and three employees per developed acre; Have an integrated mix of land uses; Have a unique history, character, and sense of place; Are of relatively higher density than the surrounding area; Have a distinct downtown\/main street (though smaller than a town center); and Are surrounded by rural and agricultural land uses.PLANNED CENTERSAre planned town-center-type developments on greenfields in Growing Suburbs or Rural Areas or through redevelopment on greyfields and\/or brownfields in Developed Communities; and Have plans that call for village-type development, incorporating mixed, integrated land uses, relatively high densities, and pedestrian connections.",

"dc_description_s": "The Connections 2040 Plan for Greater Philadelphia assesses regional trends and forecasts and sets forth a vision for the future. The Plan establishes goals and identifies strategies to achieve its core principles: managing growth and protecting natural resources, creating livable communities, building the economy, and establishing a modern, multimodal transportation system. The Plan identifies a set of transportation investments that are needed to preserve and maintain the existing system, as well as other critical improvements that make the system operate more efficiently and expand capacity. The passage of Act 89 in November 2013 will provide additional funding for transportation investments in the Pennsylvania portion of the DVRPC region. The Plan is being amended to include additional projects in the Pennsylvania subregionA key role of the Plan is to outline a vision and strategy for how the region will invest in transportation infrastructure over the next 27 years. This section lays out a vision for maintaining and improving the transportation system to achieve the future potential for Greater Philadelphia. Since we can?t afford all identified needs, the financial plan prioritizes projects for funding by developing forecasts of reasonably anticipated revenue, allocating the revenue to project categories based on need and policy, and evaluating and selecting specific major regionally significant projects for funding in the Plan. This chapter also considers how to address the transportation funding gap.DVRPC worked with PennDOT, NJ DOT, SEPTA, NJ Transit, PATCO\/DRPA, and other regional stakeholders to determine what investments need to be made over the life of Connections 2040 to maintain and modernize the region?s transportation system. At the heart of this exercise was an in-depth needs assessment utilizing asset management systems that collect detailed data and monitor the various components of the network. The needs assessment identified what is required to bring the roadway and transit systems to a state-of-good repair, and also what types of operational and system expansion projects are necessary for the region to continue to grow and prosper in the future.The needs assessment determined the projects that are necessary to achieve the goals outlined in Connections 2040. Roadway, bike and pedestrian, and transit investments are grouped into the following categories:ROADWAY SYSTEM PRESERVATIONROADWAY OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTSTRANSIT SYSTEM PRESERVATIONTRANSIT OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTSTRANSIT SYSTEM EXPANSIONROADWAY SYSTEM EXPANSIONBIKE AND PEDESTRIANFor more information, see Chaper 5 of Connections 2040 document and Amended Transportation Investments in Amended Transportation Investsments document http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/reports\/14049.pdf**PLEASE NOTE: GEOGRAPHY IS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED WITH INDIVIDUAL PARTIES**http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/Connections2040\/",

"dc_description_s": "As the region's metropolitan planning organization (MPO), DVRPC provides technical assistance and services to its member state, county, and local governments; the private sector; and the public. Delaware Valley Data is our periodic series of free data bulletins, data snapshots, and analytical data reports. This analytical data report provides revised 2040 and interim-year population and employment forecasts for the DVRPC region?s counties and municipalities. DVRPC prepared these forecasts in order to incorporate the results of the 2010 Census, account for the ongoing economic recession, and maintain a 30-year planning horizon. 2040 population forecasts were originally adopted by the DVRPC Board on January 26, 2012 and published in April 2012 in Analytical Data Report 18. On February 28, 2013, the DVRPC Board amended the 2040 and interim year population forecasts for Upper Merion Township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to account for a significant residential development that was unforeseen when the 2040 population forecasts were adopted in January 2012. This amendment resulted in corresponding revisions to the population forecasts for Montgomery County and the DVRPC region as a whole. This amended analytical data report includes these revisions. This report also consolidates the adopted population forecasts for Princeton Township and Princeton Borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, which merged and became one municipality known simply as Princeton on January 1, 2013. Additionally, inconsistencies in some summary totals in ADR 18 caused by rounding were also corrected. The adopted population forecasts provided in this report will serve as the basis for DVRPC?s planning and modeling activities, along with the 2040 employment forecasts that were prepared and adopted in September 2012.NETS database for 2010 was used for employment data.http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/asp\/pubs\/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR019http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/asp\/pubs\/publicationabstract.asp?pub_id=ADR018-ASource of geographic boundaries: DVRPC",

Attribute fields titled RASP and RASP_Type were included to indicate whether an airport is part of DVRPC's Regional Airport System Plan (RASP). The RASP currently contains 24 airports: 3 commercial, 10 reliever, and 11 general aviation or recreational facilities. In addition, the current RASP identifies three operating public use heliports and one military airbase. The DVRPC_REG field indicates whether a facility is within the DVRPC 9-county region. The FP_UPDATED field indicates the year of aerial imagery that was used to update the facility's footprint. Additional attribute data pertaining to these facilities may be sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

"dc_description_s": "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Executive Order on Environmental Justice (#12898) do not provide specific guidance to evaluate EJ issues within a region's transportation planning process. Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Indicators of Potential Disadvantage Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. DVRPC currently assesses demographic population groups from Census tables and uses it to gather data from the 2012 - 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. Using U.S. Census American Community Survey data, the population groups are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group. For more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website, http:\/\/www.dvrpc.org\/GetInvolved\/TitleVI.",
