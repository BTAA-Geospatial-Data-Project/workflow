Ineligible for Coverage under NWPs: Projects affecting high quality streams and undesignated streams draining directly to high quality streams, as represented in the map, must undergo individual 401 review process. While quality of undesignated streams within these designated catchments is unknown, we do know that impacts to these upstream waters could affect the known high quality receiving stream. As such, an individual WQC would be required, including a complete antidegradation review allowing for public comment. Possibly Eligible for Coverage under NWP - Additional Field Screening Procedures Required:Projects affecting undesignated streams within those HUC12 watersheds that do not directly but eventually drain into high quality waters, might be eligible for coverage under Ohio certification of NWPs depending on the results of an abbreviated field screening assessment.  To reproduce the colors of the online map layer use these values and colors:   Ineligible: Value = 1, color (R:197 G:0 B:255);  Possibly Eligible: Value = 2, color (R:255 G: 255 B:115);  Eligible: Value = 3, color: no color, transparent.  Color values are RGB (Red, Green, Blue).",

"dc_description_s": "The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination. To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",

This program was established in 1967 to measure seasonal and annual water quality changes in the state's major aquifers. The network initially consisted of 12 large production wells, and was expanded to 60 wells in 1972. In 1986, the network was further expanded to around 90 wells. A large number of public water supply wells were added to the network in the late 1980s and early 1990s to provide better representation of the major aquifers in Ohio.The program currently includes over 200 wells (stations). Of the total stations, roughly 85 percent are public water systems and 15 percent are industrial or commercial enterprises or residential. Raw water is analyzed for a suite of inorganic parameters every six, 18, or 36 months depending on the total number of samples that have been collected and the stability of the geochemistry of major elements at the site. Samples are also analyzed for volatile organic compounds once every 18 or 36 months. Some ambient sites have historical semi-volatile organic compounds and pesticide data.",

"dc_description_s": "Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program - Also known as Wellhead Protection and Drinking Water Source Protection, the Source Water Assessment and Protection (SWAP) program helps public water suppliers protect sources of drinking water (streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and aquifers) from contamination. The SWAP program addresses more than 4,500 public water systems in Ohio. It does not address private residential water systems. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA) - the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake. For more information on the SWAP Program, visit\u00a0http:\/\/epa.ohio.gov\/ddagw\/swap.aspx, send an email to\u00a0mailto:whp@epa.ohio.gov or call (614) 644-2752 and ask to speak with one of the Drinking Water Source Protection staff.\u00a0Data updated daily at midnight.\u00a0",

The types of sites may include licensed landfills, landfills that existed prior to state regulatory programs, exempt waste sites, unauthorized dumps, open dumps, and disposal lagoons. Some sites in the database may have been partially or fully remediated and may no longer contain significant amounts of waste.\u00a0The data are incomplete and are still in development.  New locations will be added and existing locations may be corrected.  This file does not include all sites regulated by Ohio EPA under other regulatory programs (e.g. there are many sites regulated under programs such as hazardous waste sites, surface water, \"brownfields\", etc. that are not included in this dataset).\u00a0Data were developed from Ohio EPA archival files. The accuracy of the locations depends on the available information. Where possible, points were located on the actual waste unit, or within the tax parcel boundary where the waste was said to be located. Some points were located using coordinates or descriptive text in field notes, inspection reports, etc.  In some cases, the best available information is the nearest intersection or an address. When possible the data were compared against local tax maps to improve the accuracy of the locations. Additional sources of information included but were not limited to newspaper archives, solid waste district plans, pollution inventories, historical societies, and local governments.\u00a0The information used in this dataset come from files that date back to the late 1960s and may not represent the current site conditions. The data includes only that known to Ohio EPA's solid waste regulatory program and may not include sites that were under past authority of other regulatory agencies such as local health departments.\u00a0",

The shapefiles were obtained from the Ohio Secretary of State's Office website. Detailed information regarding the development of these shapefiles can be found at: http:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/SOS\/reshape\/GADistricts\/adoptedMap.aspx. THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXERPT FROM THE\u00a0 FINAL OHIO APPORTIONMENT PLAN\u00a0 AS AMENDED, ADOPTED AND ENGROSSED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 - http:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/sos\/upload\/reshape\/GA\/Apportionment-Engrossed.pdf Part A. General Overview\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 To assist users in their review of the legislative district plan, the plan geography is being provided in different formats. These include a geographic data file known as a shape file and a tabular data file known as an assignment file. The geographic file includes the boundaries for each district. The tabular data file includes one record for the lowest level of geography used to create the plan and the district to which it is assigned.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Users with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software may note a handful of instances in which the appearance of the geography assigned to each district may not match the legal boundaries. Notes follow on these instances below.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 As a general caveat, whatever the geographic representation might appear to be when the legislative plan is viewed via any software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definitions as submitted by the Joint Secretaries to the Ohio Apportionment Board. Those definitions can be found in this document.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition for House and Senate Districts that is wholly contained within the boundaries of a district but not contiguous to any district boundary, is assigned to that district. Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition that is contiguous to any district boundary is assigned to that district with which it has the longest continuous boundary. If two or more boundaries are of equal length, the area is assigned to the district with less population. All districts are contiguous including those that are contiguous only by bodies of water.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 The legal definition will be posted at the following website designated by the Ohio Apportionment Board: http:\/\/www.reshapeohio.org.\u00a0\u00a0 [link not valid as of 2\/13\/2015] Part B. Geographic Database\u00a0 The underlying geographic database used to create plans for legislative districts was developed by the Urban Center at Cleveland State University (CSU) in conjunction with the Voinovich Center at Ohio University (OU) as part of the project to develop the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database (OCURD). CSU was selected by bipartisan action by the co-chairs of the Ohio Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment and Demographic Research. The lowest level of geography in this database is not the census block but the split census block.\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 The overall purpose of the project was to accommodate for the fact that many census blocks contain portions of multiple higher levels of geography, such as a precinct or a municipality. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018split\u2019 units because they did not nest into the higher levels of geography. The project also enabled the creation of geographic layers for wards (which were not part of the census geographic products) and precincts that more closely reflect the boundaries used in the 2008 and 2010 elections.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 To create a geographic system that allowed for topological integrity, the OCURD project used the boundaries of the higher levels of geography as overlays and assigned the underlying census block, or portions thereof, to each of the higher levels. When the higher level geography crossed the census block, a new geographic unit was created known as a split block. It is this \u2018block split\u2019 layer of geography that was the lowest level of geography from which the legislative districts were created.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Another goal of the OCURD project was to estimate the population in each portion of the split blocks. The project researched several means by which this could be accomplished and chose a method based upon the length of the streets in each such block. Because the population was estimated for each portion, the number of persons was not rounded to a whole person and thus some fractional numbers will be found.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Another issue arose as the OCURD database was being used by the Joint Secretaries of the Ohio Apportionment Board to create legislative plans. This issue relates to the fact that many of the higher levels of geography, notably municipalities, wards, and precincts, contain multiple pieces of territory that are separated by distances short and long. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018non-contiguous areas\u2019 (NCA) because there is some other land or water between the pieces. There are two types of NCAs: those that are not contiguous because they are islands surrounded by water and those that are not contiguous because they are legally or technically a portion of a geographic unit but surrounded by other land-based geographic units. Examples of the first type are the islands off the coast of Lake Erie. Examples of the second type abound in the state.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 In most cases, the multi-part units are combined for geographic representation in GIS software. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018shapes\u2019 and are assigned to a district as one unit, even though there may be separate estimates of population for the blocks that comprise the higher level unit. Because they are combined as an entire shape they can only be assigned to one district by the GIS software used for the redistricting phase of the apportionment process. The software used by the Board to undertake this process was Maptitude for Redistricting (MTR) by Caliper Corporation.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 Requirements of the Ohio Constitution relate to both creating districts from contiguous territory and the maintenance of political subdivision boundaries. Therefore, making use of a multi-part area as the boundary of a district could present a situation in which a political subdivision would be split and a district would be created using non-contiguous territory.\u00a0 7.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever the geographic representation of the GIS software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definition as adopted by the Apportionment Board. 8.\u00a0\u00a0 Because some areas in the higher geographic levels are multi-part units the software flagged some districts as being non-contiguous. Notes on these situations follow.\u00a0 \u00a0Part C. Notes on Specific Districts:\u00a0 The following areas include districts that were designated by the Maptitude software as having some non-contiguous areas:\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 District 38\u2014Stark County. Block 391517147013085 is split into two pieces including portions of precincts 151ANY &amp; 151AEB. The portion in 151ANY contains no population and is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 District 46\u2014Lucas County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Jerusalem Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 District 48\u2014Stark County. Block 391517123002009 is split into three pieces including portions of precincts 151ACD, 151AME, and 151ANG. Each of these portions contains no population. The triangular portion at the lower south east of the block is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 District 55\u2014Lorain County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Avon Lake City. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 District 83\u2014Hardin and Logan Counties. There is one unit in the \u2018Block Split\u2019 layer, 390650007003086091AAR, that is unassigned in the map. It contains no population and is surrounded by district 83. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal description.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 District 88\u2014Sandusky County. One island is located in Sandusky Bay but is a portion of Riley Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.7.\u00a0\u00a0 District 89\u2014Ottawa County. This district has three components: the portion above Sandusky Bay; the portion below Sandusky Bay; and several islands off the Lake Erie coast.

School district boundaries were created based upon voter registration records to support various initiatives across multiple state agencies. CSU, NODIS used the school district assignment on the current voter registration record to establish where the district boundaries are. The address locations of voters will be assigned to the Census Bureau's TIGER geographic database and both automated and manual procedures implemented to create the school district boundaries. In addition, the school district names were updated by comparing and reconciling the names provided on the 2001-2002 Census file with those provided in the voter registration database. In 2007, this dataset was updated for 34 counties. The school district boundaries were created from county auditor supplied parcel boundary source data. The parcel boundaries were dissolved on tax district ids to form school district polygons. The resulting polygons were then conflated to centerline, railroad, hydrography, and political boundary data to form a complete school district layer covering the entire county. The data set was last updated in 2014.",

Detailed information regarding the development of these shapefiles can be found at: http:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/SOS\/reshape\/GADistricts\/adoptedMap.aspxPart A. General Overview\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 To assist users in their review of the legislative district plan, the plan geography is being provided in different formats. These include a geographic data file known as a shape file and a tabular data file known as an assignment file. The geographic file includes the boundaries for each district. The tabular data file includes one record for the lowest level of geography used to create the plan and the district to which it is assigned.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Users with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software may note a handful of instances in which the appearance of the geography assigned to each district may not match the legal boundaries. Notes follow on these instances below.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 As a general caveat, whatever the geographic representation might appear to be when the legislative plan is viewed via any software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definitions as submitted by the Joint Secretaries to the Ohio Apportionment Board. Those definitions can be found in this document.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition for House and Senate Districts that is wholly contained within the boundaries of a district but not contiguous to any district boundary, is assigned to that district. Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition that is contiguous to any district boundary is assigned to that district with which it has the longest continuous boundary. If two or more boundaries are of equal length, the area is assigned to the district with less population. All districts are contiguous including those that are contiguous only by bodies of water.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 The legal definition will be posted at the following website designated by the Ohio Apportionment Board: http:\/\/www.reshapeohio.org.\u00a0\u00a0 [link not valid as of 2\/13\/2015] Part B. Geographic Database\u00a0 The underlying geographic database used to create plans for legislative districts was developed by the Urban Center at Cleveland State University (CSU) in conjunction with the Voinovich Center at Ohio University (OU) as part of the project to develop the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database (OCURD). CSU was selected by bipartisan action by the co-chairs of the Ohio Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment and Demographic Research. The lowest level of geography in this database is not the census block but the split census block.\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 The overall purpose of the project was to accommodate for the fact that many census blocks contain portions of multiple higher levels of geography, such as a precinct or a municipality. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018split\u2019 units because they did not nest into the higher levels of geography. The project also enabled the creation of geographic layers for wards (which were not part of the census geographic products) and precincts that more closely reflect the boundaries used in the 2008 and 2010 elections.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 To create a geographic system that allowed for topological integrity, the OCURD project used the boundaries of the higher levels of geography as overlays and assigned the underlying census block, or portions thereof, to each of the higher levels. When the higher level geography crossed the census block, a new geographic unit was created known as a split block. It is this \u2018block split\u2019 layer of geography that was the lowest level of geography from which the legislative districts were created.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Another goal of the OCURD project was to estimate the population in each portion of the split blocks. The project researched several means by which this could be accomplished and chose a method based upon the length of the streets in each such block. Because the population was estimated for each portion, the number of persons was not rounded to a whole person and thus some fractional numbers will be found.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Another issue arose as the OCURD database was being used by the Joint Secretaries of the Ohio Apportionment Board to create legislative plans. This issue relates to the fact that many of the higher levels of geography, notably municipalities, wards, and precincts, contain multiple pieces of territory that are separated by distances short and long. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018non-contiguous areas\u2019 (NCA) because there is some other land or water between the pieces. There are two types of NCAs: those that are not contiguous because they are islands surrounded by water and those that are not contiguous because they are legally or technically a portion of a geographic unit but surrounded by other land-based geographic units. Examples of the first type are the islands off the coast of Lake Erie. Examples of the second type abound in the state.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 In most cases, the multi-part units are combined for geographic representation in GIS software. In geographic terms, these are known as \u2018shapes\u2019 and are assigned to a district as one unit, even though there may be separate estimates of population for the blocks that comprise the higher level unit. Because they are combined as an entire shape they can only be assigned to one district by the GIS software used for the redistricting phase of the apportionment process. The software used by the Board to undertake this process was Maptitude for Redistricting (MTR) by Caliper Corporation.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 Requirements of the Ohio Constitution relate to both creating districts from contiguous territory and the maintenance of political subdivision boundaries. Therefore, making use of a multi-part area as the boundary of a district could present a situation in which a political subdivision would be split and a district would be created using non-contiguous territory.\u00a0 7.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever the geographic representation of the GIS software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definition as adopted by the Apportionment Board. 8.\u00a0\u00a0 Because some areas in the higher geographic levels are multi-part units the software flagged some districts as being non-contiguous. Notes on these situations follow.\u00a0 \u00a0Part C. Notes on Specific Districts:\u00a0 The following areas include districts that were designated by the Maptitude software as having some non-contiguous areas:\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0 District 38\u2014Stark County. Block 391517147013085 is split into two pieces including portions of precincts 151ANY &amp; 151AEB. The portion in 151ANY contains no population and is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 District 46\u2014Lucas County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Jerusalem Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0 District 48\u2014Stark County. Block 391517123002009 is split into three pieces including portions of precincts 151ACD, 151AME, and 151ANG. Each of these portions contains no population. The triangular portion at the lower south east of the block is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0 District 55\u2014Lorain County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Avon Lake City. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0 District 83\u2014Hardin and Logan Counties. There is one unit in the \u2018Block Split\u2019 layer, 390650007003086091AAR, that is unassigned in the map. It contains no population and is surrounded by district 83. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal description.\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0 District 88\u2014Sandusky County. One island is located in Sandusky Bay but is a portion of Riley Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.7.\u00a0\u00a0 District 89\u2014Ottawa County. This district has three components: the portion above Sandusky Bay; the portion below Sandusky Bay; and several islands off the Lake Erie coast. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.\u00a0",

The list as of October 2017 is on our website: http:\/\/www.das.ohio.gov\/Divisions\/General-Services\/Risk-Management\/Statewide-Property-Insurance-Program. It is the excel file under the Documents section titled \u201cProperty SOV.\u201d Since coverage is not required in non-state buildings, our SOV will only included leased locations that the agencies requested be added to the insurance. DAS Office of Real Estate can probably give a full list of leased locations. The agencies are currently certifying their data for the July 1st renewal. They are supposed to have all of their changes made by April 6th. I can send you an update at that time, if that will help. You will notice that some locations have records for multiple agencies, since we are now required by our carrier to specify contents and equipment values for each entity within the state building. Those records will show a $0 value for the building except for the building owner. We also have added underground tanks and pipes when the agency requests coverage for them.",

Further, according to the 2012 Arts and Economic Prosperity IV Study conducted by Americans for the Arts, $1.1 billion in economic activity is generated annually by the non-profit arts and culture industry in Washington, DC. Additionally, the culture industry returns $80 million in local tax revenue to the District s coffers. These trends create an opportunity for DCCAH to position itself at the forefront of the city s cultural planning. To achieve this goal, DCCAH will endeavor in a cultural planning process to understand the strategic opportunities that will be central to accomplishing this broad vision.",

"dc_description_s": "This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",

The map data were originally derived from the 1:24,000-scale bedrock-geology maps, which were created between the mid 1960's through 1997. Detailed mapping at 1:24,000 scale was performed in Ohio from the 1960's to the 1980's. During that time period, 37 7.5-minute quadrangles were mapped in detail. The bedrock-geology mapping program was initiated at the Ohio Division of Geological Survey in 1991 to perform reconnaissance geologic mapping at 1:24,000 scale. The reconnaissance and detailed geologic mapping have been combined together into this GIS dataset. There will be edge-matching issues between the reconnaissance and detailed geologic maps.",

The map data were originally derived from the 1:24,000-scale bedrock-geology maps, which were created between the mid 1960's through 1997. Detailed mapping at 1:24,000 scale was performed in Ohio from the 1960's to the 1980's. During that time period, 37 7.5-minute quadrangles were mapped in detail. The bedrock-geology mapping program was initiated at the Ohio Division of Geological Survey in 1991 to perform reconnaissance geologic mapping at 1:24,000 scale. The reconnaissance and detailed geologic mapping have been combined together into this GIS dataset. There will be edge-matching issues between the reconnaissance and detailed geologic maps.",

Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",

Led by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) in conjunction with the Office of Planning (OP) and the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Great Streets has grown into a multi-year, multi-agency program that utilizes public actions and resources to leverage private investment in retail, office space, housing, and cultural facilities across the District.The Government of the District of Columbia through the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) administers the Great Streets Retail Small Business Reimbursement Grants, which are competitive grants of up to $50,000 for qualified small business owners who wish to improve their place of business. The purpose of the grant program is to support existing small businesses, attract new businesses, increase the District's tax base, create new job opportunities for District residents, and transform emerging commercial corridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.If you would like to be added to the Great Streets email list to receive updates about small business opportunities in the District of Columbia, please email us at greatstreets@dc.gov.Visit http:\/\/greatstreets.dc.gov\/ for more information.",

Find more information at 'http:\/\/imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis.

For example, the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) traffic control officers who prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation. The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 40 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, where are the majority of Unsafe Operator moving violations in the AM Rush of 2014 These data will give up to 52 distinct street segments of information one for each week of the year.Field Definitions:Identification Weeknumber Week of Year, based on a Sunday start of the week StreetSeg Street Segment ID, corresponds to the DDOT street centerline StreetSegID field Registered Name Street nameStreetType Type of Street (Road, Ave, etc)Quad DC Quadrant FromAddLeft Unit number start (for approximating this segment s block) ToAddLeft Unit number end (for approximating this segment s blockMovingLow Speeding (Under 20mph) - speed violations under 20mphHigh Speeding (above 20mph) - speed violations over 20 mph including reckless drivingUnsafe Driving -violations for driving maneuvers unsafe to traffic Unsafe Vehicle - violations for vehicle characteristics unsafe to traffic Unsafe Operator- violations for operator (driver) characteristics unsafe to trafficOther- miscellaneous violationsImportant Notes: Records which could not be associated to a street centerline segment (StreetSeg) were excluded from these summariesRecords which do not have a time of day associated with the violation were excluded from these summaries.",

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of potential natural areas. The polygons contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the 2004 Oakland County Natural Areas Report update. Each feature was assigned a priority of One, Two, or Three. Digital Landcover, orthophotography, and USGS quadrangle maps were the main sources used to identify each natural area. The data from the Oakland County Natural Areas update project was collected in 2004. Key attributes include Priority and TotalScore. Priority is a reflection of quality and indicates the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state of the identified area.The NaturalArea2004 data should be distributed with the Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004. This document provides essential information for the attributes and procedures used to create the features in the dataset.

Rasegan, RA, Charlotte P. Burckhardt, AICP, PCP, Lawrence S. Falardeau, RLA, Russell Lewis, RA, Leslie E. Kettren, AICP, Jim Keglovitz, and JoAnn Browning The Shiawassee and Huron Headwaters Resource Preservation Project involved six communities (Highland, Milford, Rose, Springfield, and White Lake Townships, and the Village of Milford) in western Oakland County. A Steering Committee composed of local officials, developers, property owners, and land conservancy members was the policy group that directed the project. The Steering Committee contracted with the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) to identify potentially significant natural areas. Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - July 2002 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Michael Penskar, Program Leader - Botany Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas Report - April 2004 Prepared by: John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation Helen Enander, Information Technologist I Michigan Natural Features Inventory P.O. Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 This report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in Oakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the landscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of potential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural features. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological services such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil development and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel corridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic diversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological value of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas can also be used to update and track the status of these remaining sites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local municipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize conservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. In this report the term potential natural area has been used in place of the term potential conservation area. The substitution was made in order to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites that are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better understanding of the term natural area. The term potential natural area, however, is not to be confused with the legal term dedicated Natural Area as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which gives land special legal protection.When using this information it is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a starting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, each community, group or individual using this information should determine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. Materials and Interpretation Methodology: Interpretation of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using digital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland County Potential Conservation\/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's Planning and Economic Development Services Division. As the townships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this imagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for Geographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b), and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These additional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the interpretation process. Delineation of sites was done through aerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) wetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested tracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done conservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up being eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of omitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated by focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much development (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as possible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads, parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural areas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal boundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the boundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all sites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. Following the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential natural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each site could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total calculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.",

Another community may have three commercial districts- Neighborhood Commercial, Hi-Tech Office, and Retail Commercial. A wide range of uses could be included in these categories, but for the purpose of this feature class, they are all translated into Commercial\/Office. In some cases a category on community's future land use map could not be translated into a single composite category. When this occurred, areas were manually translated into the appropriate generalized category. For example, a Public Lands class on a community's map would be manually translated into the Public\/Institutional and Recreation\/Conservation composite categories.",

"dc_description_s": "A spatial representation of land that is protected from development by a Conservation Easement recorded with the State of Michigan. These points were manually placed to represent the location of a conservation easement using tax parcels and orthophotography as a reference. Each easement location and associated attribute information was found through a recorded document search using Access Oakland. Key attributes include: GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page.This purpose of this data is general planning purposes and cartographic output. This data can also be used in conjunction with the MNFI Natural Areas feature class to identify moderate to high quality natural areas that are not protected.Each easement was located through Land Access, Oakland County's public records search tool. A search was conducted to find all recorded documents where the State of Michigan is the Grantee and the document type is an Easement (EST). In the Recorded Document Profile search within Land Access, three separate searches were performed to identify state recorded conservation easements: - State of Mi was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Michigan Dep was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. - Department was entered as the Grantor and\/or Grantee and EST was entered for the document type.This search was last performed 11\/04\/2003. The legal description was used to identify the general location of the easement.Most often, these easements are created within a new residential development and may contain multiple conservation areas. In these cases, the point was placed in a general location within the subdivision to represent all the areas described in the conservation easement. The attribute information (i.e., GrantorName, StartDate, AcresRecorded, Liber, and Page) was also collected through Land Access.Once complete, the dataset was verified internally and checked against information obtained from the Michigan Department of Environment Quality. We contacted David R. Dortman from the Land and Water Management Division who provided a list of the easements the state had record of. The list contained the Grantor, Liber, Page, and Acreage.",

"dc_title_s": "OC Development Authority: Oakland County, Michigan",
"dc_description_s": "The DevelopmentAuthority polygon feature class identifies certain types of entities that encourage development\/redevelopment in designated areas. This feature class currently represents Downtown Development Authorities (DDA), Tax Increment Finance Authorities (TIFA), and Local Development Finance Authorities (LDFA); however, it will also depict Corridor Improvement Authorities (CIA) and Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (BRA) in the future. These five types of authorities have the ability to capture tax increment financing (TIF).The features were digitized using legal descriptions, parcel lists, and maps that were provided to the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal and\/or Oakland County Equalization by the authority. The key attributes are Name (official name of the authority), Type (the type of development authority), and DevelopmentPlan (yes\/no indicating if the feature represents an area that is part of a development plan and can caputre tax increment financing).Tax Increment Financing is a tool used to promote redevelopment and community improvement projects by channeling funding toward projects in targeted areas. TIF is captured from the increase of property values from a base year. Millage rates from taxing jurisdictions are applied to the increased value. The resulting tax revenue is directed to the authority, rather than the appropriate jurisdiction.Beginning in 1994, taxing jurisdictions have the option to opt out of having its taxes captured by the authority. Also since 1994, school taxes may no longer be captured unless they are necessary to make payments on existing eligible obligations. For more information about TIF, see Michigan Department of Treasury's Tax Increment Financing FAQ web page at http:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/treasury\/0,1607,7-121-3218---F,00.html. The State of Michigan has adopted enabling legislation to allow TIF through five types of authorities. Each type of authority has a focus relating to development\/redevelopment: Downtown Development Authority (PA 197 of 1975)'Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districts Tax Increment Finance Authority (PA 450 of 1980)Prevent urban deteriorationEncourage economic development and activityEncourage neighborhood revitalization and historic preservationClosed to new applicants since 1987Allows the development of virtually any type of land use Local Development Finance Authority (PA 281 of 1986)Encourage local developmentPromote conditions of employmentPromote economic growthLimited to business activities involving:ManufacturingAgricultural processingHigh-technology activitiesEnergy productionBusiness incubators Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (PA 381 of 1996)Promote revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain propertyFocus on tax reverted, blighted, or functionally obsolete propertyMDEQ must approve brownfield redevelopment areas Corridor Improvement Authority (PA 281 of 2005)Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districtsMust be adjacent to a road classified as an arterial or collectorThese quasi-public entities are created by resolution through a community's governing body. CIA and LDFA boundaries may cross municipal boundaries. In the case of these multi-jurisdictional authorities, both communities must pass resolutions establishing authority. There is currently only one Joint LDFA (Cities of Southfield and Troy) and there are no CIAs in Oakland County. When the community establishes the authority, it must also define the geographic boundaries in which it will operate. DDAs and CIAs are authorized to levy and collect taxes through a special assessment on all properties within the authority boundary.After the authority and its boundaries are established, the authority creates a tax increment financing and development plan. The plan estimates the amount of tax increment financing that will be captured and lists specific projects on which it will be spent. It also defines the development area where the tax increment financing and projects will occur. The development area must be completely within the authority boundary; however, it may be coincident with the authority boundary.An authority may contain multiple development areas, each with its own development and tax increment financing plan. BRAs normally designate development areas as a one or two parcels for a specific development project, while the other types of authorities define development areas as a larger area. Also, LDFAs are only allowed to capture TIF from parcels in a permitted use, such as manufacturing.There may be both eliglible and inelgible parcels within a development area; however, the inelgible parcels do not participate in TIF capture. The base year used to calculate the amount of tax increment financing is set when the development plan is adopted. If the development plan is expanded at a later date, the base year could be reset for the entire development area or the capture could be calculated using multiple base years.The source for the base year was the tax billing code used by Oakland County Equalization. When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford'Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and\/or map.For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.The data will be updated on an as needed basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments. In particular, county departments may not be aware of BRA development projects when no TIF is captured. Lastly, because the tax parcel feature class is revised periodically and it is important for the features to be coincident with the tax parcel feature class, the development authority feature class will also be updated annually to correct conflicts due to parcel shifting.",

"dc_description_s": "The primary purpose of this data is to be used by Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services, other County departments, and and local communities for planning purposes.  The two major uses are cartographic output and creating summaries at various spatial extents.The intent of this feature class was to provide a very general representation of a hard copy 1966 land use map.  The spatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature was limited by the intended purpose of the data.The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land use map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater than 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire county was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on the Landuse.Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the following process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was modifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were buffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from RoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two types (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent property was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County Register of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in liber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that simultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in 1966.  Major roads that intersected or were adjacent with these simultaneous conveyances were classified as Dedicated and the remainder of Major Roads were classified as a Perscriptive Easement.  The buffer distances, representing half the total Right-of-Way width, used for each road code are listed below:     Minor Road - 30 feet     Major Road (Perscriptive Easement) - 33 feet     Major Road (Dedicated) - 46.5 feet     State Highway - 46.5 feetU.S. Highway - 46.5 feet     Interstate - 60 feet feetThese Right-of-Way widths generally approximate those that actually existed in 1966 and are not intended to indicate the exact width of a specific Right-of-Way.  All areas completely surrounded by Right-of-Way such as between directions of travel of a boulevard or interstate or the area inside of a freeway interchange were manually attributed as Right-of-Way.Water features were burned in the final feature class using a modified version the of the Oakland County Waterbody feature class.  This data was modified to reflect waterbodies in 1966 using the 1966 land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.Lastly, the features that intersected community boudaries were split using the Identity tool to increase cartographic and analytic performance.",

The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel.

Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 'Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2008. 'Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2008 version of land use was created using the 2007 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for the 2007 update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes.

Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 2012. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2012 version of land use was created using the 2011 version as a primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented parcels. The development process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions: In 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned property during this land use update. Any parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to subdivision open space).

The Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial\/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational\/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and Conservation, and Commercial\/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW. Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions: There are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel vacant. These parcels are listed below: 01-29-451-001 01-35-300-014 04-08-200-002 04-24-100-004 07-13-301-006 14-04-376-002 18-19-476-015 21-10-200-001 21-10-200-002",

"dc_description_s": "This polygon feature class represents the spatial extent of surficial geology deposits, glacial and sub-glacial drainage, and historical glacial lake shoreline areas in Oakland County. These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. The key attribute is the geologic sediment type.The primary business purpose for the development of this data set was to collaborate with the Cranbrook Institute of Science in producing an educational map about the surficial geology of Oakland County at a scale appropriate to Countywide and sub-County applications. Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. Zawiskie QC'd the data through visual inspections of plots, and Nina Misuraca instituted the corrections.",

"dc_title_s": "Oil and Gas Fields of Ohio: Ohio",
"dc_description_s": "These maps and database are an update of the Ohio Division of Geological Survey (ODGS) oil and gas fields Digital Chart and Map Series (DCMS 13 through 21), which was completed in 1996. Previous Ohio oil and gas fields maps were also published in 1948, 1953, 1960, 1964, and 1974. The updated maps and database have been created using the GIS-based ESRI\/ARCMAP software. All documented oil and gas pools\/fields have been digitized as polygons and each polygon is linked to a unique pool\/field identification (ID) number and name. Like the previous DCMS oil and gas fields maps, the updated oil and gas pools\/fields have been grouped into 8 major plays defined by specific stratigraphic intervals. These are the 1) Pennsylvanian undifferentiated sandstones and coals, 2) Mississippian undifferentiated sandstones (excluding the Berea and Cussewago Sandstone) and Maxville Limestone, 3) Mississippian Berea and Cussewago sandstones), 4) Upper Devonian Ohio Shale and siltstones, 5) Silurian\/Devonian Big Lime interval (Onondaga Limestone, Oriskany Sandstone, Bass Islands Dolomite, Salina Group, and Lockport Dolomite), 6) Silurian Cataract\/ Medina sandstone (Clinton\/Medina) and Dayton Formation (Packer Shell), 7) Middle Ordovician fractured shale, Trenton Limestone and Black River Group and Wells Creek Formation, and 8) Cambrian-Ordovician Knox Dolomite (Beekmantown dolomite, Rose Run sandstone, Copper Ridge dolomite, B-zone, and Krysik sandstone). All oil and gas pool\/field ID's are defined and grouped by play and not geographic boundary, since most of the producing oil and gas reservoirs in Ohio occur within stratigraphic traps. This is a departure from the method used in the 1974 map in which oil and gas fields were assigned geographically, and not by producing horizon. Thus on the 1974 map, one field could contain multiple, stacked, partially overlapping, producing horizons from the Cambrian to the Pennsylvanian. Since the 1974 map was produced, over 58,000 additional wells have been drilled and completed in multiple, stacked producing horizons, mostly in unique stratigraphic traps. This has made it too cumbersome to assign all producing horizons to the same pool\/field ID within any given geographic area. Assignment of pool\/field ID's by play or stratigraphic interval provides a better geologic method of displaying and defining these pools\/fields that are dominantly stratigraphic traps. With this method of outlining polygons for producing horizons, a pool is defined as a single polygon that produces from horizons within one play. When more than one polygon is assigned the same ID within the same play, these polygons are defined as a field. Pool\/field production types are displayed as gas (red), oil (green), or storage (orange). In most cases, the assignment of production type was determined from the 1974 Ohio oil and gas field map. For updates to the 1974 map, the production type (excluding the Knox Dolomite play) was determined by the dominance of oil or gas symbol as displayed on the township well spot maps. In many cases a subjective decision was made, since many of the wells are displayed as combination oil and gas. With the Knox Dolomite play, the production type was based on gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) using data from the ODGS production database POGO (Production of Oil and Gas in Ohio). Oil production is shown for pools\/fields with a GOR less than 5,000, and gas for fields with a GOR greater than 5,000. Calculations are based on cumulative production since 1984. This method of using GOR was not possible for the other, older historical plays because of insufficient production data. Whenever possible, existing outlines from the 1996 digital oil and gas fields maps were used. Exceptions to this are in areas where the 1996-pool\/field boundaries were modified or new pool\/field boundaries were created from additional drilling. Pool\/field boundaries were digitized based upon documented wells from the ODGS township well spot maps, and in some areas from the Ohio Fuel Gas (OFG) well spot maps. The OFG maps were used primarily for the Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays because many of these older wells are not located on the ODGS township well spot maps. In some areas, digitized pools\/fields from the 1996 version were deleted if the oil and gas township and\/or the OFG maps or well cards could not verify them. A minimum of 3 producing wells within a 1-mile distance was required to draw a pool\/field outline. Storage field outlines are approximate and are based primarily on the 1974 map. In drawing new polygons for pool\/field boundaries, a buffer of 1\/2 mile was made around each producing well, and boundaries were drawn using these buffers. In assigning pool\/field ID's, the historical numbers and names from the 1974 map were maintained whenever possible. Pools\/fields may be consolidated into a larger consolidated field only if they occur within the same play. When two or more pools\/fields are consolidated, they were assigned a new field ID. The name of the consolidated field was taken from the oldest pool\/field within the consolidated field. There may be exceptions to this if the name is firmly entrenched in literature (i.e., Canton Consolidated, East Canton Consolidated, etc.). In a given geographic area of multiple producing horizons, the same ID was maintained for the dominant producing horizon. The less dominant producing horizons in other plays for this geographic area were assigned new pool\/field ID's. Every pool\/field with an assigned number has also been assigned a unique name. If it is a new pool\/field ID that was not on the 1974 map, a new name was assigned using the nearest place name (i.e., town, village, city, etc.) or a named geographic feature (i.e., stream, river, ridge, etc.) from a topographic map.",

Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation. The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 50 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, what type of parking violations occurred the most in the time period of this data These data will give up to 26 distinct street segments of information one for each week of the half year.Field Definitions:Identification Weeknumber Week of Year, based on a Sunday start of the weekStreetSeg Street Segment ID, corresponds to the DDOT street centerline StreetSegID fieldRegistered Name Street nameStreetType Type of Street (Road, Ave, etc)Quad DC Quadrant FromAddLeft Unit number start (for approximating this segment s block) ToAddLeft Unit number end (for approximating this segment s blockMovingImproper commercial and residential vehicle parkingparking in a manner impeding bicycle and pedestrian access parking meter violations miscellaneous parking violations parking in a restricted\/reserved curbside use zone residential permit parking program violationsImportant Notes: Records which could not be associated to a street centerline segment (StreetSeg) were excluded from these summaries.

"dc_description_s": "The Vision Zero data contained in this layer pertain to parking violations issued by the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and partner agencies with the authority to do so. For example, the District Department of Transportation's (DDOT) traffic control officers who prevent congestion through enforcement and control at intersections throughout the District. Locations of moving violations are identified from a database provided by the District Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).The data is summarized by ticket counts based on time of day, week of year, year, and category of violation. The summary form was created as a series of aggregated street segment data, in order to view spatial patterns on a weekly basis. This is a temporal crosstab of violation types (defined below) by week and time of day (ranges defined below).Users are able to query by week to get a DC-wide yearly and weekly perspective on over 50 different combinations of violations. Create interesting street segment heat maps which can get quite specific to identify patterns and answer questions. For example, what type of parking violations occurred the most in the time period of this data These data will give up to 26 distinct street segments of information one for each week of the half year.Field Definitions:Identification Weeknumber Week of Year, based on a Sunday start of the weekStreetSeg Street Segment ID, corresponds to the DDOT street centerline StreetSegID fieldRegistered Name Street nameStreetType Type of Street (Road, Ave, etc)Quad DC Quadrant FromAddLeft Unit number start (for approximating this segment s block) ToAddLeft Unit number end (for approximating this segment s blockMovingImproper commercial and residential vehicle parkingparking in a manner impeding bicycle and pedestrian access parking meter violations miscellaneous parking violations parking in a restricted\/reserved curbside use zone residential permit parking program violationsImportant Notes: Records which could not be associated to a street centerline segment (StreetSeg) were excluded from these summariesRecords which do not have a time of day associated with the violation were excluded from these summaries.",

"dc_description_s": "Since the publication of the Glacial map of Ohio (Goldthwait, White, and Forsyth, 1961, U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Geologic Investigations Map I-316), many workers have continued efforts to decipher the Quaternary history, geomorphology, and deposits of Ohio. This map of the Quaternary geology of Ohio attempts to consolidate this improved understanding of Quaternary geology in a uniform format for the entire state.Compilation ws begun by the late Dr. Richard P. Goldthwait, to whom this map is dedicated. Additional revisions and compilation of a series of 1:250,000-scale open-file maps (Ohio Division of Geological Survey Open-File Maps 291-300, 1993) were completed by staff of the Ohio Geological Survey, prior to preparation of this map. The individual maps used to compile this map differ widely in age, scope, and detail. Many areas of complex geology have been simplified to fit the scale and map units of this map. Refer to the data sources listed below for available maps that have more detail at a larger scale. The geological units on this map are grouped by age, depositional process, (water-deposited, ice-deposited, etc.), and geomorphic occurance (ground moraine, end moraine, hummocky moraine, etc.). For example, the most common unit in northeastern Ohio is G4, a Late Wisconsinan-age clayey till (Hiram Till) depositied as ground moraine.",
