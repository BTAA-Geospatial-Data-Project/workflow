"dc_description_s": "NALOXONE_PROVIDERS_ISDH_IN.SHP is an Esri point shapefile showing the locations of 705 registered Naloxone Entities in Indiana. These registered entities can dispense naloxone to people without a prescription (no prescription is needed). A person seeking naloxone can ask the entity to use the state health commissioner's \"Statewide Standing Order.\" The Statewide Standing Order, authorized by I.C 16-42-27, is renewed each year. Naloxone Entities must at all times remain compliant with Indiana law to act under the Statewide Standing Order, and abide by the attestations made on the optIN Registry website. All entities are also required to provide training for usage of naloxone, as well as to provide other available addictions resources within Indiana. Attribute information includes entity name, address, contact phone, contact email, and website URLs.  NOTE: NALOXONE_PROVIDERS_ISDH_IN.SHP should not be considered completely current, as entities could potentially be added or removed from the registry since the last date of publication (20180226). Further, entities that temporarily run out of naloxone stock are temporarily removed from the live optIN Registry website, and are reinstated when the ISDH is notified that the entity has been resupplied with dosages. For the most current information about Naloxone Entities in Indiana, and other related online resources, please visit the ISDH optIN Registry website ( https:\/\/optin.in.gov\/ ).",

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named \"NHD_LOCALRES_CLASSIFIED_IN\":  \"In order to meet the USGS NHD data model for flowlines, all new flowlines resulting from the Indiana NHD local resolution upgrade project that could not be categorized (artificial path, canal\/ditch, coastline, connector, pipeline, stream\/river perennial, stream\/river intermittent, or underground conduit) were given an FTYPE of Stream\/River and an FCODE of Stream\/River (46000). Those features are considered to be Unclassified Flowlines and were not loaded into this dataset. Only records from the reprojected NHDFlowline feature class where FCODE <> 46000 were loaded into this dataset. All records where FCODE = 46000 can be found in the Unclassified Flowline dataset.\"  \"The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\"",

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named \"NHD_LOCALRES_UNCLASSIFIED_IN\":  \"In order to meet the USGS NHD data model for flowlines, all new flowlines resulting from the Indiana NHD local resolution upgrade project that could not be categorized (artificial path, canal\/ditch, coastline, connector, pipeline, stream\/river perennial, stream\/river intermittent, or underground conduit) were given an FTYPE of Stream\/River and an FCODE of Stream\/River (46000). Those features are considered to be Unclassified Flowlines and were loaded into this dataset. Records from the reprojected NHDFlowline feature class where FCODE = 46000 were loaded into this dataset. An 'INDIANA_CLASS' field was added to the feature class and all records were given a value of 'Unclassified Flowline.' The 'FCODE' and 'FTYPE' attribute fields were then deleted. All records from the source NHDFlowlines where 'FCODE' <> 46000 can be found in the Classified Flowline dataset.\"  \"The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\"",

Many other datasets are referenced to this mileage information, and therefore this dataset is considered by the Division of Water to be the official mileage for these streams.  \"Stream mileage maps for streams in Indiana were originally developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Louisville, Detroit and Chicago districts) and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, from 1965 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1973. These maps depict stream mileages in tenths of a mile (with exceptions) mapped on USGS 7 \u00c2\u00bd minute quadrangle maps, at a scale of 1:24000. Methodology for determining stream mileage largely follows the document \u00e2\u0080\u009cRiver Mileage Measurement\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Water Resources Council, 1968. Points representing each tenth of a mile were captured by DNR staff using georectified copies of the original source documents. These points are attributed with the stream name as shown on the original documents, and the basin, from the Division of Water standard basin schema. This dataset was developed in 2016.  \"Updated hydrographic dataset sources (namely the USGS National Hydrography Dataset) are captured to a much finer resolution than was possible when this data was originally compiled. Additionally, rivers and streams are dynamic, eroding and depositing material and changing course over time, sometimes significantly. Limitations of this dataset compared to other derivations of stream mileage should be recognized.  \"Stream mileage for the Ohio River were taken from the USGS 7 \u00c2\u00bd minute quadrangle maps, and are shown at 1 mile increments. Mileage for the Ohio River is historically taken as miles from Pittsburgh (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers).  \"Discrepancies in the original maps include: Missing mileage data for miles 569-579 for the Ohio River in the Bethlehem quad, an extra 1\/10 of a mile between miles 66.5 and 67 for Sugar Creek in Basin 19, an extra 1\/10 of a mile between miles 17.5 and 18 for Middle Fork Blue River in Basin 27, an extra 1\/10 of a mile between miles 17.5 and 18 for Little Calumet River in Basin 1.\"",

"dc_title_s": "Estimated Percent Change of Impervious Surface, Derived from the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Database: Indiana",
"dc_description_s": "IMPERVIOUS_SURFACE_CHANGE_2001_2006_USGS_IN is a raster layer (30-meter cell size) containing the percent difference of impervious-surface values in Indiana that changed between NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness. This raster layer is a subset of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2006) suite of data products.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:  \"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state\/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992\/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.  For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001\/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001\/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001\/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001\/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path\/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001\/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.  In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  The NLCD 2006 is created on a path\/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.  Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS\/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.\"",

"dc_description_s": "IMPERVIOUS_SURFACE_2006_USGS_IN is a grid (30-meter cell size) showing estimated percentages of impervious surfaces in Indiana in 2006.This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2006) suite of data products. The attributes are percentage values of estimated impervious-surface cover within each 30-meter grid cell, or pixel.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:  \"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state\/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992\/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.  For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001\/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001\/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001\/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001\/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path\/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001\/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.  In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  The NLCD 2006 is created on a path\/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.  Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS\/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.\"",

The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri personal database format and was named \"Coal_Combustion_Waste_20151113.MDB\" that contained a polygon feature class named \"INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS.\" COAL_COMBUSTION_WASTE_IMPOUNDMENTS_INSPECTED_IDEM_IN.SHP is attributed with observations by IDEM staff and information found in US EPA contracted reports about the structural integrety and hazard potential some of the impoundment dams.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source feature class INSPECTED_CCW_IMPOUNDMENTS:  \"CCW impoundments were digitized by IDEM staff from aerial photo-interpretation. This was done in response to the CCW impoundment failure at the TVA\/Kingston coal burning electric generating facility during December of 2008, and IDEM's recognition of the need to know the precise locations of these waste features, and what impacts similar failures may have on the Indiana landscape. Also in response to this failure, US EPA initiated a nationwide program assessing the structural integrety and safety of CCW impoundments. US EPA contracted for inspections of these facilities, and information from the reports of Indiana facilities are included in the IDEM developed attributes of these features. The attributes, information about the features in tabular format, were compiled from information taken from the published reports of impoundment inspections done by US EPA contracted firms, and notes from IDEM field inspections, as well as observations made by IDEM GIS staff as the features were digitally mapped. The qualitative and quatitative attributes provide information of impoundment size, capacity, dike\/dam hazard potential, types of waste placed in the impoundment, owner, facility name, impoundment use, and field observations by IDEM inspectors and USEPA contrated specialists.  \"The USEPA contracted nation wide reports are found: http:\/\/www3.epa.gov\/epawaste\/nonhaz\/industrial\/special\/fossil\/surveys2\/index.htm#_ga=1.5580723.182041078.1443707387  \"From the EPA reports: 'A CCW management unit is defined as a surface impoundment or similar diked or bermed management unit or management units designated as landfills that receive liquidborne material and are used for the storage or disposal of residuals or by-products from the combustion of coal, including, but not limited to, fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, or flu gas emission control residuals.

"dc_description_s": "LAND_COVER_2011_USGS_IN is a grid (30-meter cell size) showing 2011 Land Cover data in Indiana. This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2011) data set. There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2011_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2011:  \"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014).  For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover 2) NLCD 2006\/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness 4) NLCD 2006\/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center.  In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path\/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006\/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products were revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path\/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS\/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.\"",

"dc_description_s": "LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN is a grid (30-meter cell size) showing 2006 Land Cover data in Indiana. This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2006) data set. There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:  \"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state\/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992\/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.  For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001\/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001\/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001\/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001\/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path\/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001\/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.  In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  The NLCD 2006 is created on a path\/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.  Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS\/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.\"",

Lands are classified as Federal (USFWS), State (Pike State Forest), or Private.  Users should be aware that other state lands including more tracts of the Pike State Forest and the Sugar Ridge Wildlife Management Area adjoin or are near the refuge purchase boundary depicted. The data set provided was in an ESRI shapefile format and was named Tract Owners 83. This file was cleaned and reattributed by Bernardin, Lochmueller & Associates. The land within this shapefile is very near the legislative boundary, \"the boundary of potential federal land acquisition\", with only a small piece of USFWS owned land occurring outside this delineation. Some areas owned by FWS are closed to hunting, consult Patoka River NWR for information.  This file is not survey quality.  Boundaries were placed using USGS DRGs and lines were sometimes shifted (30-90 feet) to enable hardcopy presentation.",

"dc_description_s": "The following is excerpted from an unpublished report by Michael Brower (2004):  \"Using the MesoMap system, TrueWind has produced maps of mean wind speed in Indiana for heights of 30, 50, 70, and 100 m above ground, as well as a map of wind power at 50 m. TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data.  \"The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m.  \"The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m\/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W\/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m\/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m\/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named \"NHD_LOCALRES_AREA_IN\":  \"This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\"",

The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named INDUSTRIAL_WASTE. WASTE_INDUSTRIAL_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identification numbers, federal identification numbers, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Industrial Waste Section, Compliance and Response Branch, Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source feature class INDUSTRIAL_WASTE:  \"This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems as an intergral part of data management for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  This set consists of known sites with Industrial Waste. Industrial Waste Compliance GPS Points locate the entrance to facilities that generate and\/or manage hazardous waste, non-hazardous industrial waste, and solid waste. The majority of the points collected are Large Quantity Generators (LQGs). Treatment Storage and Disposal facilities (TSDs) are also being collected. Occasionally, a Small Quantity Generator (SQG) or Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) GPS points may be collected if the location has significant environmental issues.  GPS data is collected, with portable GPS equipment, by Industrial Waste Compliance staff during scheduled compliance Inspections. GPS points may also be logged at nearby LQGs when the compliance inspector is conducting other compliance work in the area.  TSD - Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility is a facility that may treat, store, and \/or dispose hazardous waste. The facility is usually also a generator of hazardous waste.  LQG - Large Quantity Generator is a facility that generates more than 1,000 Kilograms (2,200lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  SQG - Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 1,000 Kilograms (2,000 lbs.) but more than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  CESQG - Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  Industrial Waste site inspectors were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems.  Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites.  This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and QA\/QC'd before being deposited in a central archive.\"",

The following was excerpted from the website for the Natural Resources Commission:  \"In 1993, the Natural Resources Commission adopted its \"Outstanding Rivers List for Indiana.\" The listing was published in the Indiana Register on March 1 of that year as Information Bulletin #4 in Volume 16, Number 6, page 1677 through 1680 (sometimes cited as 16 IR 1677). The listing has also been specifically incorporated by reference into statutes and rules. Notably, the listing is referenced in the standards for utility line crossings within floodways, formerly governed by IC 14-28-2 and now controlled by 310 IAC 6-1-16 through 310 IAC 6-1-18. See, also, the general permit for logjam removals, implemented as an emergency rule and pending for adoption as a permanent rule at 310 IAC 6-1-20. Except where incorporated into a statute or rule, the listing is intended to provide guidance rather than to have regulatory application.  A special listing was prepared by the division of outdoor recreation of the department of natural resources. The listing is a corrected and condensed version of a listing complied by American Rivers and dated October 1990. There are about 2,000 river miles included on the listing, a figure which represents less than 9% of the estimated 24,000 total river miles in Indiana. The natural resources commission has adopted the listing as an official recognition of the resource values of these waters.\"",

The file was created using 1:100,000 scale data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), therefore, the lines remain in the NHD reaches, resulting in multiple line segments for each NRI listing. The line segments have NOT been dissolved. The start and end point of each listing segment is approximate and located by described landmarks.  The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a river to be listed-  In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology, including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural, cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process. In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the words \"unique\" and \"rare\" indicate that such a value would be one that is conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are themselves uncommon or extraordinary. Only one such value is needed for eligibility.\u0094",

The data stewards determine which data are published and should be contacted for any questions on data content or for additional information. The cadastral publication data is data provided by cadastral data producers in a standard form on a regular basis. Cadastral publication data has two primary components, land parcel data and cadastral reference data. It is important to recognize that the publication data are not the same as the operation and maintenance or production data. The production data is structured to optimize maintenance processes, is integrated with internal agency operations and contains much more detail than the publication data.

"dc_description_s": "ZCTA_TIGER05_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA's) for the state of Indiana. This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER\/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs):  \"ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs\u0099) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  \u0095 ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  \u0095 ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPS\u0092s ZIP Code delivery areas.  \u0095 ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  \u0095 ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  \u0095 ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  \u0095 ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  \u0095 ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  \u0095 ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  \u0095 ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another.\"  For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http:\/\/www.census.gov\/geo\/ZCTA\/zcta.html  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:  \"The 2005 First Edition TIGER\/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER\/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER\/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2005 First Edition TIGER\/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers\/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude\/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.\"",

The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named \"BROWNFIELDS.\"  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS:  \"Indiana defines a brownfield site as a parcel of real estate that is abandoned or inactive; or may not be operated at its appropriate use; and on which expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated; because of the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum, or a petroleum product that poses a risk to human health and the environment.  As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable buildings and infrastructure already present.  The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation resources can lower the costs to a potential developer.  Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight.  Because the potential environmental liability at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup costs.  Thus, the properties remain idle.  In response to these issues the IDEM, in conjunction with the Indiana Development Finance Authority,and the Indiana Department of Commerce offers financial assistance in the form of grants and low-interest loans for site assessment, remediation, and demolition.  The IDEM provides assistance by performing technical oversight and review.\"",

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named \"NHD_LOCALRES_WATERBODY_IN\":  \"This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\"",

"dc_description_s": "Aquifer_Recharge_Near_Surface_IN is a raster data layer that displays the results of a regression analysis to determine the estimated rate of diffuse groundwater recharge to the water table in shallow aquifers in Indiana based on numerous landscape-level variables as predictors. The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to estimate groundwater recharge rates in both glaciated and driftless environments. This groundwater-recharge raster layer was developed by combining a multiple regression analysis of groundwater recharge with characteristics of near-surface geologic materials. The groundwater recharge data used in the multiple regression analysis was derived from calculations of groundwater baseflow and surface-water runoff for 279 streams in Indiana. Estimates of groundwater base flow were determined using hydrograph separation analysis (Institute of Hydrology, 1980) determined using a local-minimums approach with a recession slope test, and were converted to recharge by multiplying by using estimates of runoff following Wolock (2003). The baseflow index (BFI) provides the proportion of runoff that is assumed to be groundwater contribution, so recharge was estimated as BFI * interpolated statewide runoff (not runoff per basin). The average annual rate of groundwater recharge (in\/year) was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis using ordinary least squares with several landscape and morphometric independent variables representing geologic, terrain, climate, and hydrogeologic characteristics. The regression model developed for Indiana had a global R2 value of 0.50, and the most influential variables at the 95% confidence level were:  - Cumulative percent area of upstream impervious surfaces - Surface clay thickness - Percent of clay in soil - Average annual air temperature - Presence\/absence of unconsolidated aquifers - Slope of ground surface - Cumulative percent area of upstream water bodies - Sand composition of water well boreholes - Cumulative percent area of upstream medium-height vegetation - Hydrologic group classification of soil (A,B,C,D - SSURGO)  The regression model was used as a mapping tool to spatially distribute estimates of recharge across Indiana, incorporating details of the important landscape variables.",

This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD 2001) data set. Estimates of impervious surfaces are shown in this data set as percentages when the associated layer file (IS2001USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2001 (http:\/\/extract.cr.usgs.gov\/distmeta\/servlet\/gov.usgs.edc.MetaBuilder?TYPE=HTML&DATASET=NLCD01IMPV&YMAX=39.611501479289956&YMIN=39.611501479289956&XMIN=-76.63165680473374&XMAX=-76.63165680473374):  \"The National Land Cover Database 2001 impervious surface layer for mapping zone 60 was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and <http:\/\/www.mrlc.gov\/mrlc2k.asp>.  \"The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC), Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.\"",

Points represent monitoring stations attributed as occuring within the state of Indiana or along the Ohio River in Kentucky, or in Illinois along Lake Michigan. Joinable tables must be utilized to access data at specific stations for specific parameters. Five tables are available - tissue residue data (tischem.dbf), sediment chemistry data (sedichem.dbf), screening value, cancer slope factors, and noncancer reference doses for chemicals (reftabl.dbf), watershed summary data (watersh.dbf), biotoxicity data (biotox.dbf).  US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports -  \"This dataset describes the accumulation of chemical contaminants in river, lake, ocean, and estuary bottoms and includes a screening assessment of the potential for associated adverse effects on human and environmental health. EPA evaluated more than 21,000 sampling stations nationwide using sediment chemistry data, chemical residue levels in edible tissue of aquatic organisms, and sediment toxicity data. Of the sampling stations evaluated, 5,521 stations were classified as Tier 1 (associated adverse effects are probable), 10,401 stations were classified as Tier 2 (associated adverse effects are possible, but expected infrequently), and 5,174 stations were classified as Tier 3 (no indication of associated adverse effects). Ninety-six watersheds were identified as areas of probable concern for sediment contamination. EPA believes that these watersheds represent the highest priority for further ecotoxicological assessments, risk analysis, temporal and spatial trend assessments, contaminant source evaluation, and management action because of the preponderance of evidence in these areas (although further evaluation is necessary). Also see the related report entitled The Incidence And Severity Of Sediment Contamination In Surface Waters of the United States, Volume 1, National Sediment Quality Survey (EPA 823-R-97-006, <http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/OST>) that was published in September 1997. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format.\" \"This data set provides individuals with observation level data that were used in the most geographically extensive investigation of sediment contamination ever performed in the United States. Based on this evaluation, sediment contamination exists at levels where associated adverse effects are probable in some locations within each State of the country.\"",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands Project Metadata layer, which contains project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.\"",

In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution. Since these features no longer exist, boundary delineations are considered approximations based on topography, previously mapped information or indications of historic water levels.\"",

"dc_description_s": "HOSPITALS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains hospital locations, as developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named \"2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp.\"  The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC):  \"Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)  After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation\u0092s critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.  \"HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as \u0093disclosure\u0094 in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.  \"HSIP Freedom: NGA\u0092s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach \u0096 HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.  \"The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the \"License Free\u0094 HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.\"  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named \"2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp\":  \"Hospitals in Indiana  \"The term \"hospital\" means an institution which:  \"(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients  \"  (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or \"  (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;  \"(5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times; ...  \"(7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals,  \"  (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or \"  (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing;  \"(Excerpt from Title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(e)], <http:\/\/www4.law.cornell.edu\/uscode\/html\/uscode42\/usc_sec_42_00001395---x000-.html>)  \"Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.).  \"TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical\/surgical hospitals in Indiana. Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in Indiana are represented in this dataset.  \"Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA) are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals.  \"Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a separate dataset.

The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach \u0096 HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.  \"The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the \"License Free\u0094 HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.\"  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named \"2008_09_20_IN_EMS.shp\":  \"EMS Locations in Indiana  The EMS stations dataset consists of any location where emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Ambulance services are included even if they only provide transportation services, but not if they are located at, and operated by, a hospital. If an independent ambulance service or EMS provider happens to be collocated with a hospital, it will be included in this dataset. The dataset includes both private and governmental entities.  \"This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.  \"The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.  \"Records with \"-DOD\" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.  \"Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.  \"All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.  \"The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

Since 1980, staff members of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) have also collected and entered coal resource information into the NCRDS Database as a cooperative project with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The purpose of NCRDS Database is to provide a means of rapid retrieval of point-source coal resource information, including coal location, extent, and other parameters. Based on all available NCRDS data and data provided by Phil Ames from the Peabody Coal Company as of April 2014, a new map of Hymera Coal Member extent was created. It is the most current extent map of the Hymera Coal Member. Because additional data on coal extent are obtained by the Indiana Geological Survey on an annual basis, interested users may wish to contact the IGS for information on these more up-to-date sources.",

"dc_description_s": "SEISMIC_SHAKING_PREDICTED_RESPONSE_RP35_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the distribution and classification of National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil types. This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana.  The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column.  Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5):  A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana.  B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0.  C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2.  D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6.  E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5.  F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable.  The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35:  \"The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios.  \"Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the results of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map.\"",

Based on all available data as of October 2010, a new map of Springfield Coal Member elevation was created. It is the most current elevation map of the Springfield Coal Member.

Permissive tracts have been defined by the U.S. Geological Survey (Open File Report 95-681, Singer, D.A., 1993, Basic concepts in three-part quantitative assessments of undiscovered mineral resources: Nonrenewable Resources, v. 2, no. 2, p. 69-81) as \"areas where the geology permits the existence of mineral deposits (mineral resource potential) of a specific type...

The resource potential of each map unit within the mapped surficial unconsolidated deposits is ranked as a \"potential,\"  \"low potential,\" or \"not a potential\" resource. The definitions of these rankings are derived from Gray, H.

M., 1970, Sand and gravel resources of Indiana: Indiana Geological Survey Bulletin 42-D, 31 p.  \"Potential resource\" indicates that the surficial unconsolidated deposits are likely to contain economic concentrations of sand and gravel, \"low potential\" indicates that the surficial unconsolidated deposits may contain economic concentrations of sand and gravel, and \"not a potential resource\" indicates that the surficial unconsolidated deposits do not contain economic concentrations of sand and gravel.",

The following discussion is derived from Memorandum Report 98: \"The Microsoft Access 2000 database PrelimSdGvDB.mdb on the enclosed CD contains information about abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana. The data contained in this database represents a preliminary stage in a comprehensive compilation of abandoned sand and gravel pit data stored in the files of the Mineral Resources Section of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The data were taken from a single Mineral Resources Section file titled \"DATA TABULATION CARDS: Sand and Gravel Pits\" which documents abandoned sand and gravel pits examined by IGS geologists in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although these data have been assembled into a simple flat-file database they should not be regarded as a final compilation of the above mentioned file nor should they be regarded as a compilation of all abandoned sand and gravel pit information filed in IGS Mineral Resources Section files.

The data set provided by IDEM was in an ESRI geodatabase format and the feature class was named \"MGPs.\"  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile MGPs:  \"MGPs produced gas for lighting, heating, and cooking from the 1850\u0092s to the 1940\u0092s.  In addition to producing the desired product, gas, numerous toxic by-products (such as tars and purifier wastes) were often stored in subsurface structures or disposed of in the dump areas at the site.  Significant amounts of contamination usually occurred at these sites due to the nature of gas production and poor housekeeping.  MGPs productions decreased and were phased out in the 1940\u0092s due to the increase network of natural gas pipelines across the country.  These plants were decommissioned by razing the building but leaving subsurface structures and wastes in place.  There are at least 74 known former MGPs in Indiana.\"",

"dc_description_s": "FIRE_STATIONS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of fire station, as developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named \"2008_09_20_IN_Firestations.shp.\"  The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC):  \"Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)  After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation\u0092s critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.  \"HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as \u0093disclosure\u0094 in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.  \"HSIP Freedom: NGA\u0092s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach \u0096 HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.  \"The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the \"License Free\u0094 HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.\"  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named \"2008_09_20_IN_Firestations.shp\":  \"Fire Stations in Indiana  \"Any location where fire fighters are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Fire Departments not having a permanent location are included, in which case their location has been depicted at the city\/town hall or at the center of their service area if a city\/town hall does not exist. This dataset includes those locations primarily engaged in forest or grasslands fire fighting, including fire lookout towers if the towers are in current use for fire protection purposes. This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire fighting training academies are also included.  \"This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.  \"The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into one working file.  TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.  \"Records with \"-DOD\" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.  \"Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.  \"All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.  \"The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable.  The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the \"1998 Congressional Plan A\" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, \"97 House\/Senate Plan A,\" unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, \"97 House\/Senate Plan A,\" (reflected in the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 108th Congress is the first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data.\"",

"dc_description_s": "The following is excerpted from the metadata for OHIN_ECO:  \"The ecoregions shown here have been derived from Omernik (1987) and fr refinements of Omernik's framework that have been made for other projects. These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies, involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of reference sites.  Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar.  The most immediate needs are to develope regional biological criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint source pollution.  The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995).  These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife,  and hydrology.  The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level.  Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme has been adopted for this effort.  Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent is subdivided into 32 classes.  Level III is the hierarchical level shown on this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further subdivided to level IV.  The applications of the ecoregions are explained in Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and regional projects.  For additional information, contact James M. Omernik, U.S. EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL), 200 SW 35th St., Corvallis, OR 97333 (phone: 541-754-4458).\"",

"dc_description_s": "Data regarding children (ages 5 to 17) from families in poverty in Indiana in 2004, tabulated by school district, were obtained from a Web page of the U.S. Census Bureau. These data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children.  The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006.  Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http:\/\/www.census.gov\/geo\/www\/cob\/sd_metadata.html):  \"School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.  \"Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.\"",

"dc_description_s": "CENSUS_BLOCKGROUPS_TIGER2011_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains 2011 census block group boundaries for the state of Indiana. Census block groups are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census data.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named \"TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau):  \"Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to Block Group 3. As with block groups delineated for Census 2000, block groups delineated for 5-38 the 2010 Census generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Most block groups were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.  \"A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one block group and block groups are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas.  \"Block groups have a valid range of 0 through 9. Block groups beginning with a 0 generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census trac boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and block group of 0 to the offshore areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Because of updates since 2000, there are 0 block groups that now contain land.\"",

Census tracts are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census data.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named \"TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau):  \"Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and are reviewed and updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.  \"Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tracts are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  \"Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.\"",

The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named \"TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau):  \"Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by non-visible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city. Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and\/or transmission line rights-of-way. In remote areas census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. A block may consist of one or more faces.  \"Blocks never cross county or census tract boundaries (See Figures 3 and 4). They do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data, including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas, congressional districts, county subdivisions, places, state legislative districts, urbanized areas, urban clusters, school districts, voting districts, or ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) or some special administrative areas such as military installations, and national parks and monuments.  \"Census 2010 blocks are numbered uniquely within the 2010 boundaries of each state\/county\/census tract with a 4-digit census block number.

"dc_description_s": "CHILDREN_POVERTY_2011_USCB_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile of 2011 unified school districts in Indiana. It also contains 2011 census data showing percentages of children in poverty for each school district for the state of Indiana. Poverty data were provided by personnel of the Indiana Business Research Center (Rachel Strange, Geodemographic Analyst, Managing Editor, IBRC), which were obtained from the Web page of the U. S. Department of Commerce, U. S. Census Bureau, titled \"Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates,\" <http:\/\/www.census.gov\/did\/www\/saipe\/data\/interactive\/#>. Discussion of these data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, are provided at <http:\/\/www.census.gov\/did\/www\/saipe\/about\/index.html>.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named \"TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau) and also from the Web page of the SAIPE program:  \"School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels biennially from state school officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts.  \"The 2011 TIGER\/Line Shapefiles include separate shapefiles for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. The 2011 shapefiles contain information from the 2009-2010 school year. The 2009-2010 school districts represent districts in operation as of January 1, 2010.  \"The elementary school districts provide education to the lower grade\/age levels and the secondary school districts provide education to the upper grade\/age levels. The unified school districts are districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists (see exceptions described below), and where there is an elementary school district the secondary school district may or may not exist (see explanation below).  \"The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program provides annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all school districts, counties, and states. The main objective of this program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions. In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs.  \"The SAIPE program produces the following county and state estimates: Total number of people in poverty. Number of childer under age 5 in poevery (for states only). \u00e2\u0080\u00a2number of related children ages 5 to 17 in families in poverty. Number of children under age 18 in poverty.
