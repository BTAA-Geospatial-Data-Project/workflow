  "dc_description_s": "Requires logging in through an organization with licensed access. Different institutions may have licenses for different years. Using an innovative approach with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing, ORNL's LandScan, at approximately 1 km resolution, is the finest resolution global population distribution data available and represents an ambient population (average over 24 hours). The LandScan algorithm uses spatial data and imagery analysis technologies and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate censuscounts within an administrative boundary. Since no single population distribution model can account for the differences in spatial data availability, quality, scale, and accuracy as well as the differences in cultural settlement practices, LandScan population distribution models are tailored to match the data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and region ... The LandScan dataset, first produced in 1998, is updated annually by incorporating new spatial data and imagery analysis into the distribution algorithms.",
